<h4>B. DESCRIPTION<a class="headerlink" href="#b-description" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The Nuclear Engineering Teaching Laboratory (NETL) Pneumatic Transfer System (PTS),
sometimes referred to as a “rabbit” system, is used to transport sample vial (rabbits or carriers)
between a fume hood in room 3.102 and the TRIGA Reactor Core in room 1.104. This
procedure details the operation of the system and the requirements that must be met in order to
use it for the production of radioisotopes and/or Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA).</p>
<p>The pneumatic transfer system shuttles samples by air changes of air pressure between two
system end points, a loading port and the irradiation terminal. Controls for the system allow
manual operation or automatic operation with preset times for the irradiation period. This system
enhances the production of short half-life radioactive materials.</p>
<p>Two different size irradiation terminals and transport tubes are available. Each terminal and
transport tube system requires different transport capsule sizes. The outside diameter of both
terminal sizes is designed to fit in a standard fuel element position. The two terminals have
different internal diameters, a large diameter for use with General Atomic standard reusable
capsules of high-density polyethylene, and a small interior diameter for use with disposable low-
density polyethylene capsules. Two small diameter irradiation terminals are available that
provide different characteristic neutron flux profiles. One terminal is a standard terminal for
thermal neutron irradiation. The other terminal has a cadmium lining for epithermal neutron
irradiation.</p>

<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>USE OF THE NETL PNEUMATIC TRANSFER SYSTEM</strong></p>
</div></blockquote>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Determine which type of irradiation terminal and transport tube system is needed.</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>Large tube transport system, GA Terminal. There is no maximum power limit for use of the large tube GA transfer tubes and terminal. Transport capsules for the GA terminal are reusable 20 to 25 times. A periodic inspection of the transport capsule should be done to avoid capsule breakage during irradiation.</p></li>
<li><p>Small tube transport system, standard Terminal. There is no maximum power limit.</p></li>
<li><p>Small tube transport system, Cd-lined Terminal. The maximum power limit for the small tube terminals is 500 kW. This limit is based on terminal temperature and vial temperature characteristics necessary to assure vial deformation does not cause the vial to become stuck in the core terminal. Transport capsules are not reusable.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>The user must have completed the NETL Radiation Safety Training Course and be familiar with the operation of the controls for the Pneumatic Transfer System. The Reactor Supervisor or his designee shall train new users of the system.</p></li>
<li><p>Submit an “Operation Request” and “Irradiation Request” defining the reactor operating requirements and type of samples. Specify type of use of the Pneumatic Transfer System as radioisotope production or Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA).</p></li>
<li><p>Each sample shall be characterized as <strong>solid</strong> or <strong>non-solid</strong> (such as fine powders, volatile compounds, liquids or gases).</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>All solid samples shall be contained within a primary vial with a thermal type seal.</p></li>
<li><p>The transport or carrier capsule does not provide a thermal seal for solid or non-solid samples.</p></li>
<li><p>A secondary thermal type containment is a requirement for each non-solid sample. A secondary containment may consist of a plastic bag with a heat type thermal seal.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Samples to be irradiated in the small tube terminal must be packaged in the appropriate carrier vial. The system design is for a 0.650 inch diameter capsule in a 0.685 diameter transport tube. Each carrier vial must pass through a test port. Limiting operating temperature for low-density polyethylene is 85°C.</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>Use Adanac type carrier vials that have a smooth cap, a double ridge for cap retention, and a smooth flush cast bottom.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not use similar vials made by Emerald (formerly Olympic) which have a molded strip across the cap and a molded name in the bottom.</p></li>
<li><p>Test each transport capsule prior to use in the PTS loading port.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>USE ONLY A CAPSULE THAT PASSES THROUGH THE TEST PORT</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>The user must establish communication with the Reactor Operator via the Reactor Control Room Intercom System. A radiation monitor must be available to monitor the radiation dose prior to handling samples after irradiation in the reactor core.</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>Announce the insertion of each sample into the reactor.</p></li>
<li><p>Measure the radiation dose of each sample prior to removal from the loading port.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>The Lockout Key at the control unit located in the Reactor Control Room will be turned ON by the Reactor Operator when personnel and irradiation conditions are ready. A six minute time period provides purge of the pneumatic tube system with CO2. During the purge period both the RED LED and the GREEN LED illuminate for six minutes. At the end of pneumatic tube system operation turning the Lockout Key OFF will light the RED LED and GREEN LED for two minutes.</p></li>

<h3>PURPOSE<a class="headerlink" href="#purpose" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>

<h3>DESCRIPTION<a class="headerlink" href="#description" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Analysis of the radiation energies of the unstable radioactive isotopes
that occur by neutron capture reactions provides information that
qualitatively identifies the elements in a sample and quantitatively
determines the amount of the corresponding stable elements. This
description applies to three types of materials with irradiation times of one
hour to 60 hours. Material types are biological, geological and
engineering.</p>
<p>Long-lived nuclides are those radionuclides that will occur by
irradiating samples in the Rotary Specimen Rack (RSR) and at the Center Tube
Facility (CTF). One consequence of the irradiation time is sample handling
hazards that depend on the sample decay time.</p>
<p>In the case of the CTF, sample encapsulation must be water tight and
consist of two encapsulation boundaries. Sample encapsulations must be
compatible with the experiment facility environment, air or water. If a
fuel element core position (FECP) or external core irradiation tube (ECIT)
is available the sample requirements are the same as for the RSR and CTF.</p>

<h3>PROCEDURE FOR SAMPLE IRRADIATION<a class="headerlink" href="#procedure-for-sample-irradiation" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>User must complete request forms to schedule operation. The necessary
forms are the “Operation Request” form and “Sample Radiation or Exposure”
form. Forms are available from the Reactor Supervisor.</p>
<p>The experiment authorization contains an “Irradiation of Material
Worksheet”. The worksheet provides guidance to assure that a request meets
the requirements of the NAA experiment authorization.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sample preparation and encapsulation are the responsibility of the user.
Encapsulations must meet the requirements for this class of experiments.</p>
<p>Every effort should be taken to avoid any sample leakage. A leaking
sample may cause the loss of one sample or the loss of an entire batch of
samples if measurements indicate that unsafe handling conditions exist.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The reactor operator shall inform the user of any change to the
scheduled irradiation date and time.</p></li>
<li><p>Loading and unloading samples in the reactor requires the actions of a
reactor operator and the health physicist.</p>
<p>The experimenter with the approval of the reactor operator may assist
with the loading of samples into irradiation rabbits and reactor experiment
facilities. However, the experimenter must have had radiation safety
training to assist with the unloading of any sample from an experiment
facility.</p>
<p>A unique sample identification name or number will be recorded with the
loading and unloading date and time of each sample within any experiment. A
log record of the samples is kept in the “Sample Log (in-core)” or “Exposure
Log (ex-core)”. User may submit an extra sheet with the same format to list
more samples.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Notify the Reactor Operator or his representative of the loading.
Record the loading of each sample. Record each sample identification and
the reactor irradiation position.</p>
<p>A record must exist of the samples or an entry for each sample must be
made in the sample log. Controls on the sample type and size are set by the
NAA Experiment Authorization.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Notify the Health Physicist or his representative of the unloading.
Review each sample identification and the reactor irradiation position.
Measure and record the radiation dose at 30 cm for the unloading of each
sample.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If the sample radiation dose rate is less than 100 mrem/hr &#64; 30 cm then
the sample may be made available to process as necessary for the experiment.</p></li>
<li><p>If the sample radiation dose rate is more than 100 mrem/hr &#64; 30 cm but
less than 500 mrem/hr, a swipe must be taken to check for leakage of the
sample encapsulation. If the sample radiation dose rate is more than 500
mrem/hr &#64; 30 cm the sample may not be taken from the reactor pool until decay
to a level acceptable for removal.</p></li>
<li><p>Leaking samples shall not be made available for experiment measurements.
Encapsulation of a leaking sample may provide recovery of the sample for
experiment measurements.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>An RWP (rm 1.104 pool) will exist for removal of samples from the pool
and storage prior to processing.</p></li>
<li><p>Sample transfer from the reactor pool to the processing area shall use a
sample carrier to control contamination and radiation exposure. Sample
transfer between the Reactor Bay (1.104) and Sample Handling Lab (3.102)
shall use the sample pass-thru port.</p>
<p>Exceptions may be made by the reactor supervisor for special conditions
or when sample geometry prohibits such transfers.</p>
</li>
