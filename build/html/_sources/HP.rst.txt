HP-001 Padiation Monitoring - Personnel
=======================================

INTRODUCTION
------------

A. PURPOSE

To describe the requirements and methods for dose assessment and contamination monitoring of personnel and visitors at the Nuclear Engineering Teaching Laboratory (NETL). Questions concerning this procedure may be addressed to the NETL health physicist.

B. DESCRIPTION

Title 10, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 20 defines a Restricted Area as "...an area, access to which is limited by the licensee for the purpose of protecting individuals again undue risks from exposure to radiation and radioactive materials." This procedure outlines the monitoring requirements for individuals who enter any Restricted Area within the NETL.

Accurate assessment of personnel exposure is necessary not only to comply with applicable regulations, but to evaluate the licensee's ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) program effectiveness. Therefore, it is incumbent upon all personnel at the NETL to be cognizant of, and ensure compliance with, the requirements of this procedure.

C. SCHEDULE

Apply as necessary for access to Restricted Areas. Records of personnel dosimeters should be reviewed at monthly intervals.

PROCEDURE
---------

A. Personnel Dosimeter Requirements

   1. The Health Physicist is responsible for periodic review of activities in the NETL to ensure that the proper dosimeter is provided. However, it is the ultimate responsibility of each person who enters a Restricted Area to ensure that the proper dosimeter is worn for the activity performed.

   2. Any personnel who enter a Restricted Area at the NETL are required to wear a dosimeter. The type of dosimeter required is determined by the Health Physicist, or in his or her absence, the NETL Director, Associate Director, Reactor Supervisor, or a Senior Reactor Operator.

   3. Personnel dosimeter is to be worn on the portion of the body that is expected to receive the highest dose. For most applications, the dosimeter should be worn in the chest or belt area. For special applications, the dosimeter location may be adjusted at the discretion of the Health Physicist.

   4. Special dosimeters (i.e., rings, neutron badges, etc.) shall be worn at the direction of the Health Physicist.

   5. Personnel assigned a permanent record dosimeter may be required to wear a pocket dosimeter in addition to their permanent record dosimeter in accordance with RWPs, other procedures, or as directed by Health Physics.

B. Personnel Permanent Record Dosimeter

   1. Based on a review by the Health Physicist, personnel may be required to wear a permanent record dosimeter.

   2. Permanent record dosimeters are typically provided and processed by a NVLAP accredited vendor.

   3. Personnel required to wear a permanent record dosimeter must complete and submit a "Request for Dosimetry Service."

C. Personnel Pocket Dosimeters

   1. During work in a Restricted Area, the pocket dosimeter shall be checked periodically to monitor dose. When a pocket ion chamber type dosimeter exceeds three-fourths of scale, the wearer shall exit the area, record the dose, and re-zero the pocket ion chamber before continuing work in the Restricted Area.

   2. All personnel who use a pocket ion chamber shall record their dose on a log sheet such as HP-001 Form A. Each person is responsible for completing the log sheet as follows:

      a. Prior to entering a Restricted Area, obtain a pocket ion chamber and check that the reading is between 0 and 10% of full scale. If necessary, zero the dosimeter.

      b. Record your name, the date, the dosimeter ID, and the initial reading on the log sheet.

      c. At the end of the work day, record the dosimeter reading on the log sheet.

      d. Calculate the daily dose by subtracting the dosimeter initial reading from the final reading and record this value on the log sheet.

   3. All personnel who use an electronic dosimeter shall have their dose recorded as follows:

      a. Prior to entering a Restricted Area, check that the assigned electronic dosimeter is working properly (battery OK, etc.)

      b. At intervals determined by the HP (typically monthly), submit the dosimeter to the HP for download and review of dose data.

.. note::
   It is the responsibility of each individual to practice ALARA and ensure that their dose does not exceed any applicable limit.

D. Visitors

A visitor is any individual who is not a NETL radiation worker.

   1. Escorts

      a. A NETL radiation worker is capable of providing escort into Restricted Areas, although additional qualifications might be required for some areas based on security.

      b. Escorts of visitors are responsible for their visitors at all times. Visitors should remain within the escort's line of sight at all times. The escort is responsible for the visitor's adherence to established radiological procedures, and response to emergency signals.

      c. Escorts are responsible for ensuring that their visitor(s) have the proper dosimeter in compliance with this procedure.

      d. Escorts are responsible for completing the information in the visitor dosimeter record (e.g., HP-001 Form B).

   2. Dosimeters

      a. Visitors who will enter a Restricted Area shall be issued a pocket dosimeter.

      b. Groups of visitors which will remain together at all times (such as tour groups) may be issued one dosimeter per each ten members of the group.

E. Abnormal Conditions

   1. Lost Dosimeter

      Immediate Actions

      a. Initiate a quick check of the immediate area to determine if the dosimeter has fallen in the vicinity.

      b. Exit the Restricted Area and contact the Health Physicist.

      Supplementary Actions

      a. Assist the Health Physicist in estimating dose by recalling activities performed, materials used, time in Restricted Areas, etc.

      b. Procure replacement dosimeter, and initiate a search for the lost dosimeter.

   2. Pocket Dosimeter Anomalies

      Anomalies such as off scale or inconsistent readings or visitor dosimeters with greater than 2 mrem dose indicated must be investigated.

      Immediate Actions

      a. Initiate a quick check of other available dosimeter in the immediate area to determine if the dose is valid.

      b. Exit the Restricted Area and contact the Health Physicist.

      Supplementary Actions

      a. Assist the Health Physicist in determining the cause by recalling activities performed, materials used, time in Restricted Areas, etc., and whether the pocket dosimeter has been dropped or bumped.

      b. Health Physicist may perform surveys of the area and estimate true exposure.

      c. Record the estimated dose as directed by the HP.

      d. Remove the suspect dosimeter from service until it is evaluated and determined to be working properly.

F. Contamination Monitoring

Good contamination control technique should be practiced when in a Restricted Area.

   1. Personnel and visitors who have been in a Restricted Area should check themselves for contamination using the portal monitor, hand and foot monitor, or a manual frisk prior to leaving the NETL.

   2. If contamination is detected:

      a. Remain in the local area (if safe to do so) to avoid spreading contamination.

      b. Contact Health Physics.

      c. Determine specific area of body and/or clothing that is contaminated.

      d. Remove and contain contaminated clothing.

      e. Wash contaminated skin with mild soap and water.

      f. Assist the Health Physicist in determining the cause by recalling activities performed, materials used, Restricted Areas entered, etc.

HP-003 NELT ALARA Program
=========================

INTRODUCTION
------------

A. PURPOSE

The objectives of the ALARA program are to maintain exposures to ionizing radiation and releases of radioactive effluents at levels that are As Low As Reasonably Achievable within the established dose equivalent and effluent release limits of the appropriate regulatory authority. This procedure is intended to establish specific guidelines to ensure that operations at NETL are conducted with ALARA principles in mind. Questions concerning this procedure may be addressed to the NETL health physicist.

B. DESCRIPTION

Current regulations limit occupational radiation dose to 5 rem/year and public dose to 100 mrem/year. The overall ALARA objective for the NETL is to be well below the regulatory limits.

C. SCHEDULE

Apply good ALARA principles continuously.

PROCEDURE
---------

A. ALARA Program Commitment

1. The NETL is an education, research, and service facility consisting of a TRIGA Mark II reactor and various associated laboratories. The mission of the facility is to further education and research and to perform service work within the scope of the licenses granted by Federal and State agencies. Exposure of personnel to various types of radiation, and release of effluents to the environment are inherent consequences in the pursuit of these objectives. A careful balance must be maintained between the pursuit of these objectives and the consequences involved in the quest.

   The management of the NETL is firmly and unequivocally committed to keeping exposures to personnel and the general public as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) without seriously restricting operation of the facility for purposes of education, research, and service.

2. The NETL Health Physicist is the individual given explicit responsibility and authority for implementation of the radiation protection program. General responsibilities and organizational relationships of the Health Physicist follow the guidelines of ANSI/ANS-15.11. Specific responsibilities and organization requirements are found in applicable sections of the UT TRIGA Safety Analysis Report and the facility operating license Technical Specifications. Program requirements also extend to the university broad radioactive material license.

B. Training

The ALARA concept is emphasized during specialized initial training and continuing education which is provided for personnel allowed unescorted access to any restricted areas of the NETL.

C. Facility Design

The NETL facility was originally designed with consideration and implementation of the ALARA principles. Any design changes must incorporate ALARA considerations. Facility design changes must consider the descriptions in the UT TRIGA Safety Analysis Report and the requirements of 10CFR50.59.

D. Facility Operations

The NETL facility operates with ALARA in mind. Both for routine and special operations, consideration is given to such items as preoperational planning and briefings, temporary shielding, radiological monitoring, and many other items pertinent to control of radiation exposures.

E. Review and Audit

1. Major activities are reviewed in a timely manner to verify that planning was sufficient.

2. The Health Physicist shall review all occupational exposures at least quarterly and report to management any exposures in excess of the limits established in section F.

3. The NETL ALARA program shall be reviewed at least annually by an ALARA committee typically consisting of the NETL Director, Reactor Supervisor, NETL Health Physicist, and the Radiation Safety Officer. The facility radiation protection program shall also be reviewed during the ALARA program review.

F. Radiation Control

NETL Health Physics procedures establish requirements for personnel radiation monitoring and facility radiation monitoring. These procedures uphold safe radiological practices at NETL and assist in keeping personnel and public exposures ALARA.

In support of ALARA, the NETL occupational dose limit for the typical radiation worker is established as the total effective dose equivalent equal to 1000 mrem per year. Additionally, the NETL public dose limit is set to 50 mrem per year. For special categories of radiation workers (declared pregnant workers, minors, etc.), the dose limit will be established on a case-by-case basis by the NETL Director with concurrence from the HP.

If it appears there is a need to exceed these dose limits, the situation will be reviewed by the Health Physicist and the NETL Director. If the need is justified, the NETL Director, with concurrence from the HP, will assign a new NETL dose limit specifically for the reviewed situation.

G. Contamination Control

Good contamination control techniques, including contamination surveys, are important for maintaining exposures ALARA and should be practiced routinely when working in Restricted Areas. The surveys provide assurance that contamination does not extend to other areas.

The recommended acceptable surface contamination levels for unconditional release are given in ANSI/ANS-15.11 as:

1. Beta/gamma contamination – 5000 dpm per 100 cm² fixed and 1000 dpm per 100 cm² removable  
2. Alpha contamination – 100 dpm per 100 cm² fixed and 20 dpm per 100 cm² removable  

In support of ALARA principles, operations within Restricted Areas will be conducted such that contamination levels are maintained as close as possible to the release limits.

H. Radioactive Effluent Control

The NETL was constructed with specialized containment and ventilation systems such that effluents are well controlled. Review procedures also assure that processes are designed to minimize production of effluents.

During normal operation, no radioactive liquid effluent is expected to be produced and released from the NETL. However, liquid from laboratory sinks can be routed to radioactive waste storage tanks. Liquid from the tanks can be analyzed and if necessary, diluted, processed and/or stored prior to release in compliance with the limits of 10CFR20 and 25TAC289.

During normal operation, significant airborne radioactive particulates are not expected to be produced and released from the NETL. However, a continuous air monitor samples the reactor bay air during operation and provides an indication of airborne radioactive particulate concentration to allow evaluation with respect to occupational and effluent limits in 10CFR20 and 25TAC289.

During normal operation, gaseous radioactive effluent is produced and released from the NETL (primarily Ar-41). A special exhaust system captures and removes a significant portion of the radioactive gas from occupied areas to reduce occupational exposure. A gaseous continuous air monitor is installed in the special exhaust system which provides an indication of airborne radioactive gas concentration to allow evaluation with respect to occupational and effluent limits in 10CFR20, 25TAC289, and the facility operating license.

Continuing education shall cover topics which are radiation protection related and may be in the form of classes, seminars, self-study, and/or other formats approved by the NETL Health Physicist.

Maintaining in good standing a professional license or certification which has a formal radiation protection related continuing education requirement (NRC Reactor Operator License, Certified Health Physicist, National Registry of Radiation Protection Technologists, etc.) shall be considered to satisfy the NETL radiation protection continuing education requirement.

C. Visitors
-----------

A visitor is any individual who has not completed radiation protection training as described in Section II.A. As visitors are escorted by NETL radiation workers, visitors are not required to complete any formal radiation protection training. However, prior to entry into any Restricted Areas in NETL, the visitor’s escort may provide a briefing of pertinent subjects such as dosimeter use, special precautions to be observed, emergency procedures, etc.

D. Other Training
-----------------

Non-routine activities may require specialized radiation protection training. The Health Physicist, as part of the activity review, shall determine the appropriate training. If it is determined that specialized training is required, all personnel involved in the performance of the activity shall complete the training prior to participation in the activity.

E. Records
----------

Records of the training required by this procedure shall be maintained (typically by the NETL Health Physicist) in a format acceptable for inspection. The attachment “Personnel Training Record” is an example of an acceptable record format.

HP-005 Radiation Protection Instrument Test and Calibration

2. Various equipment technical manuals  


PROCEDURE
---------

A. Instrument Checks – Portable Instruments

Prior to use, an instrument should be checked for proper function. The actual checks performed depend on the particular instrument but typically consist of the following:

1. Perform a visual inspection of the instrument looking for obvious signs of damage. Pay particular attention to the thin windows of probes. If the instrument appears damaged, take it out of service and report it to the NETL HP.

2. Check calibration sticker to ensure that the instrument calibration is current. If the instrument is out of calibration, take it out of service and report it to the NETL HP.

3. Perform the power up tests. This typically includes such things as battery, high voltage, and zero tests. If the instrument fails any of these tests, take it out of service and report it to the NETL HP.

4. Check the “Response Check” tag to ensure that the instrument has been response checked for that day. If not, perform the response check by exposing the instrument to a known source of radiation. If the instrument responds appropriately, initial and date the Response Check tag.


B. Calibration Requirements

1. Calibration Frequency:

   All instruments shall be calibrated annually unless noted otherwise.

2. Calibration Methods:

   In general, calibration shall be made using an appropriate radiation source depending on the type of radiation the instrument is designed to detect. At least two radiation exposure values should be checked for each meter scale on instruments used for measuring radiation fields. Instruments utilized for surface contamination measurements are typically calibrated with a pulse generator. Check appropriate calibration sources to determine efficiency and with approved radiation sources to determine accuracy. Radiation sources shall be traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Attachments to this procedure provide detailed steps to calibrate specific instruments in use at NETL. If no attachment is available for an instrument, follow the manufacturer’s technical manual. At a minimum, the following shall be checked:

   i.   Verify instrument is free of significant contamination.  
   ii.  Set meter to zero or point specified by manufacturer.  
   iii. Check battery or power is OK.  
   iv.  Turn on and warm up if required.  
   v.   Check electrical settings such as H.V. are OK.  
   vi.  Expose instruments to NIST traceable calibration source. Detector source geometry and scattering or buildup should be considered when appropriate.  
   vii. Calibrate all instruments with linear scales at approximately 20% and 80% of each scale and instruments with log or digital scales at the midpoint of each decade. For frisker type probes expose probe to Beta and/or Alpha reference sources and calculate and record efficiencies for the instrument.  
   viii. After any adjustments, calibrated instrument should read within 20% of expected values. Instruments which do not read within 20%, shall be tagged and removed from service for repair. If only one scale or decade is out of calibration, the instrument may be deemed calibrated provided a very obvious tag or marking is affixed to the instrument indicating the non-functional scale or decade.  
   ix.  Record calibration data on applicable forms.  
   x.   A calibration sticker shall be attached to all calibrated instruments showing the last calibration date, who performed the calibration, and the next calibration due date.


C. Records

The NETL Health Physicist shall maintain all instrument calibration records required by this procedure.

PROCEDURE
---------

A. Restricted Areas

An area where radioactive materials are used and/or stored shall be considered a Restricted Area and posted appropriately.

1. Typically, an entire room is designated as a Restricted Area. But if appropriate, only a section of a room may be designated as a Restricted Area and posted.  
2. Unescorted access to Restricted Areas is limited to properly trained individuals.

B. Radioactive Material Control

1. Radioactive materials shall be secure at all times.  
   a. All radioactive materials shall be physically secured by being stored in a locked container, cabinet, room, etc.  
   b. When not physically secured, radioactive material shall be accompanied by a properly trained individual at all times.  
2. Radioactive materials (including contaminated items) shall be marked by labeling the item or its container with a radioactive material label, yellow and magenta tape, or other similar method. If not practical, the item may be maintained within a designated radioactive material work area.  
3. Contaminated items not currently in use should be sealed in bags, wrapped in plastic, or controlled in other ways to minimize spread of contamination.  
4. Materials irradiated for experiments shall be logged using a form approved by the HP and/or Reactor Supervisor (such as HP6-a1, HP6-a2, or sample log book for pneumatic samples). “In-core” refers to placement within the core region.

C. Transfer of Radioactive Material

1. Transfer of radioactive material outside the NETL requires approval of the Health Physicist or a Senior Reactor Operator.  
2. Prior to the transfer, the HP or SRO will confirm that the receiving person is authorized to possess the radioactive material.  
3. Once authorized, the HP or SRO will arrange proper packaging and transport.  
4. Records will be maintained using a form approved by the HP.

D. Release of Radioactive Material

1. Items to be released for unrestricted use must have a direct radiation survey performed using the appropriate survey instrument.  
   a. Survey must be done where background is sufficiently low.  
   b. All surfaces of the object must be surveyed.  
2. If no detected activity above background → item may be released.  
3. If activity is detected → swipe test:  
   a. If removable → decontaminate and resurvey.  
   b. If not removable → HP evaluates proper disposition.  
4. Survey records must be maintained by the Health Physicist.

E. Radioactive Waste

All NETL users are responsible for minimizing radioactive waste generation. Waste must be stored in Restricted Areas.

1. Dry solid waste includes contaminated or activated materials (e.g., gloves, pipette tips, vials, samples).  
   a. Contaminated items are placed in yellow bins.  
   b. Activated samples in labeled containers in designated areas.  
   c. Large items must be covered, labeled, and moved to RAM storage.  
   d. HP staff collects dry waste for proper disposal.  
2. Liquid waste includes NAA samples and standard solutions.  
   a. Use compatible, non-breakable containers with lids.  
   b. Containers must be labeled and stored properly.  
   c. Notify HP staff for collection.  
3. Final disposal by HP staff:  
   a. Short half-life → decay then disposed as regular trash.  
   b. Long half-life → transferred to EHS.  
   c. Mixed waste → handled case-by-case.

HP-007 Radiation Work Permits
=============================

INTRODUCTION
------------

A. PURPOSE

To describe the requirements for, and administration of, Radiation Work Permits (RWP) for the Nuclear Engineering Teaching Laboratory (NETL).

B. DESCRIPTION

The Radiation Work Permit is an administrative control used at the NETL for the protection of personnel and visitors. An RWP is issued for non-routine situations where there is a high potential for a significant radiological hazard. The RWP ensures effective control of personnel exposure from radiation fields and radioactive contamination. The RWP requires radiation workers and supervisors to evaluate each proposed task with respect to the radiological hazards. This evaluation, with assistance from the NETL Health Physicist, results in identification of the personnel protection practices applicable to the task. In addition, the RWP provides a permanent record of task performance and exposure that is helpful in preparing for future tasks.

C. SCHEDULE

Apply as necessary for non-routine situations with significant radiological hazard. Review, and if necessary, re-issuance of RWPs should be at annual intervals.

3. Research Reactor Industry Standard ANSI/ANS-15.11-2009, "Radiation Protection at Research Reactor Facilities."

PROCEDURE
---------

A. Requirements for Issue

An RWP must be issued prior to work under conditions that follow if the work is not already covered by a documented procedure:

1. Work involving significant changes to reactor shielding.  
2. Work in a known High Radiation Area.  
3. Work in a known Airborne Radioactivity Area.  
4. At the discretion of the Health Physicist based on review of proposed work.

Note: Experiment activities may require an RWP. In such cases, both the RWP and experiment authorization must be approved prior to starting work. Related RWP requests should be submitted concurrently with experiment authorization requests.

B. Administration

1. The individual in charge of the task (RWP initiator) is responsible for completing the sections of the RWP describing the work to be done, location of the work, time frame the work will be done, and list of persons authorized to perform the work. Discussion of the task with the Health Physicist concerning the radiological implications of the task should occur during this phase.  
2. The RWP is submitted to the Health Physicist for review and approval. The Reactor Supervisor (or designee) must also approve the RWP. If it is likely that a person, while working under the RWP, will receive a dose greater than 100 mrem, the ALARA committee must approve the RWP.  
3. The Health Physicist assigns an RWP number, logs the RWP, and completes the appropriate sections of the RWP.  
4. The Health Physicist returns the RWP to the initiator who signs the RWP Briefing Log to indicate acknowledgement of the work conditions and requirements.  
5. RWPs are normally issued for a specific time period. If an RWP will expire prior to completion of work, the RWP initiator shall contact the Health Physicist for RWP extension approval prior to expiration of the RWP.  
6. The RWP initiator is responsible for the following:  
   a. Ensuring that all personnel who will be working under the RWP have read and signed the RWP.  
   b. Notifying personnel in adjacent areas of potential hazards of the work and possible impact.  
   c. Enforcing the requirements of the RWP.  
   d. Closing out and completing the RWP when the task is finished, and returning the RWP to the Health Physicist.  
7. All personnel who work under an RWP shall read the RWP and indicate acceptance and understanding of the conditions by signing the RWP.  
   *Note: Failure to follow the provisions of an RWP will result in withdrawal of RWP work privileges.*  
8. Each person who works under an RWP shall record their pocket dosimeter reading before commencing and after completing work. If an individual starts and stops work several times on the same RWP, the pocket dosimeter readings shall be recorded for each time period.  
9. The RWP for a task shall be located near, but not necessarily inside, the work area.  
10. The Health Physics staff will perform any confirmatory surveys after the RWP has been returned. The Health Physics staff will also perform any surveys as required by other NETL HP Procedures.  
11. The RWP initiator may make additions to the list of persons authorized to work under their RWP, with the concurrence of the Health Physicist. Concurrence of the Health Physicist is required for verification/documentation of the level of training of the person(s) working under any RWP.  
12. Visitors will not normally be allowed into situations governed by an RWP. However, if a visitor requires entry to a situation in which an RWP has been issued, the RWP Initiator (or designee) and a notation will be made in the Visitor RWP Entry Log indicating the visitor was approved and who provided the escort.

C. Fixed Radiation Work Permits

1. A Fixed RWP is one that is written for an area that is permanently established for a task that is periodically performed.  
2. A Fixed RWP shall be administered as described in section II.B. However, the ALARA committee must review and approve all Fixed RWPs.  
3. The Health Physicist shall review each active Fixed RWP monthly to ensure that the conditions of the RWP are sufficient for the area or task. The Health Physicist may make any necessary changes to account for area or task changes; however, the ALARA committee must review any substantive changes in a timely manner.

D. Records

1. The Health Physicist shall maintain a file of all completed RWPs.  
2. All expired RWPs (unless granted an extension) shall be returned to the Health Physicist even if the RWP was never used.
