OPER-5 Air Confinement System Operation
=======================================

I. INTRODUCTION
---------------

A. Purpose
^^^^^^^^^^

This procedure details the steps for operation, mode change, startup, shutdown, and response to abnormal conditions for the air confinement system.

B. Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The air confinement system is composed of the room enclosing the reactor and two air ventilation systems. The reactor room walls, weather-stripping at doorways and the ventilation ducts confine the airflow pathway through the reactor bay.

The main HVAC system is composed of fans, ducts, heating-cooling coils, and environmental controls for temperature and humidity of room air. The system also maintains a negative pressure in the reactor bay with respect to adjacent spaces for leakage path control. Isolation dampers are installed in all ducts entering and exiting the reactor bay. Isolation dampers close automatically if the particulate air monitor senses a high airborne radiation level. Operation of the system is in either the re-circulation mode for economy or in the intake-exhaust mode providing at least two fresh air changes per hour for reducing the buildup of radioactive gases during reactor operation.

The argon purge system is a separate exhaust system that can be operated to reduce the quantity of radioactivity released to the bulk air in the reactor bay. The system draws air directly from the reactor pool surface and from experimental cavities. This air is then exhausted through a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter to the exterior of the building. An Argon-41 monitor samples, displays, and records the radioactivity levels of the argon purge system exhaust.

Visual, audible and remote alarms indicate abnormal levels of radioactivity in either the particulate air monitor or gaseous argon-41 monitor. The particulate air monitor provides the signal, to stop ventilation fans and close isolation dampers.

A fume-sort hood for radioactive sample handling with HEPA filter and isolation damper can also exhaust air from the reactor bay. Configuration of the fume-sort hood is not complete for experimental use. The system has been designed and tested to meet the general requirements of the reactor bay ventilation system. Operation procedures of the fume-sort hood in SURV-5 are for test and demonstration only. Detailed operation procedures and an RWP will be developed prior to its use.

C. Schedule
^^^^^^^^^^^

Apply this procedure daily or each time the reactor is taken through an operation cycle of startup and shutdown.

II. PROCEDURE
-------------

A. General Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Verify reactor room confinement CAMs are operating.  
   The CAMs are the particulate monitor and Ar\ :sup:`41` gaseous activity monitor.

2. Verify HVAC automatic isolation feature is functional.  
   Use record of most recent function check during the last system surveillance.

3. Operate the HVAC system in the REACTOR ON or OFF mode.  
   Refer to Reactor Room HVAC procedures (Section B).  
   HVAC operation controls room air dilution rates and effluent radioactivity.  
   HVAC system operation in REACTOR OFF mode re-circulates reactor bay air,  
   REACTOR ON mode operation exhausts reactor bay air and supplies fresh air.

4. Operate the Argon Purge system.  
   Refer to Argon Purge System procedures (Section C).  
   Purge system exhausts Ar\ :sup:`41` effluent from reactor areas.  
   Ar\ :sup:`41` production occurs in air that is found in the areas of the reactor core.  
   Two production sources are air in the reactor water and air in experiment facilities.

5. Monitor operating confinement system’s performance.  
   Refer to instructions in Attachment for response to abnormal conditions.  
   Determine the cause of each abnormal condition.  
   Implement corrective or maintenance actions for conditions.  
   Abnormal conditions that substantially affect system performance are of two types:  
   a. One type affects the air confinement isolation function of the system.  
   b. The other type affects control of room pressure differences (> 0.04 inches). Measure pressure difference between the reactor room and adjacent areas.  
   Report abnormal conditions to a supervisory operator.

6. Do NOT operate Fume-Sort Hood system without an experiment approval.  
   Operate Fume-sort hood according to experiment requirements and limitations.  
   Refer to appropriate Procedures for the experiment. *(No Procedures currently exist.)*

B. Reactor Room HVAC System
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Operation

   a. Verify HVAC system is operable, refer to last monthly surveillance per SURV-5.  
      i. Confinement isolation by an automatic trip signal shall be operable or corrective action being taken  
      ii. Automatic trip of HVAC duct isolation dampers shall be operable or corrective action being taken  
      iii. Automatic trip of HVAC fans shall be operable or corrective action being taken  
      Particulate air monitor provides automatic trip signal (set point 10,000 cpm).  
      Isolation may also be initiated by manual shutdown.

   b. Determine HVAC system mode required:  
      Normal HVAC system mode is REACTOR ON if reactor is operating.  
      HVAC system shall be in the REACTOR ON mode if the Argon purge system is OFF and the reactor is operating.  
      The HVAC system may operate in the REACTOR OFF mode during reactor operation only if the argon purge system is operating, or corrective action is being taken.

   c. Operate HVAC system for confinement of room air.  
      Control HVAC system operation from the Control Room Panel (CRP).

   d. Check readings on air particulate monitor.  
      Mark reactor run #, date, startup, and shutdown times on chart record.

   e. Monitor system operation and room confinement control.  
      Review status lights on the CRP for area differential pressures.  
      Review status lights on the CRP for exhaust velocity of exhaust fans.

2. Mode Change - REACTOR OFF to ON

   a. Turn REACTOR FAN SYSTEM switch to REACTOR ON  
   b. Verify REACTOR MODE ON lamp illuminates  
   c. Verify SUPPLY FAN ON and RETURN FAN ON lamps illuminate  
   d. Verify ROOM EXHAUST VELOCITY status lamp is green  
   e. Check NORMAL status on all area pressure monitors

3. Mode Change - REACTOR ON to OFF

   a. Turn REACTOR FAN SYSTEM switch to REACTOR OFF  
   b. Verify REACTOR MODE OFF lamp illuminates  
   c. Verify SUPPLY FAN ON and RETURN FAN ON lamps extinguish

C. Argon Purge System
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Operation

   a. Verify Ar\ :sup:`41` purge system is operable, refer to last monthly surveillance per SURV-5.  
      i. HEPA filter must be in place and operable or corrective action being taken  
      ii. Automatic trip of Ar\ :sup:`41` purge system isolation dampers shall be operable or corrective action being taken

   b. Startup Argon Purge System to control the room Ar\ :sup:`41` activity.  
      Normal Argon Purge System mode is ON if reactor is operating.  
      Argon Purge System must operate or corrective action in progress if:  
      - the reactor is operating and  
      - the HVAC system is not in the REACTOR ON mode  
      Release of the inert gas occurs by diffusion from the pool water and core cavities.  
      Annual continuous Ar\ :sup:`41` average release limit is 2E-6 µCi/cm³  
      Equivalent to ≈540 cpm on Ar\ :sup:`41` CAM  
      Maintain release records for total periodic release calculation.

   c. Check alignment of two pneumatic controlled Ar\ :sup:`41` exhaust valves.  
      - Valves control POOL SURFACE PURGE and BEAM PORT PURGE  
      - Manual air dilution valve provides dilution of the purge exhaust air. Valve normal position is fully open for 100% dilution of humid pool surface air. This reduces air humidity before HEPA filter.

   d. Check readings on Ar\ :sup:`41` monitor at startup and shutdown  
      Mark reactor run #, date, startup, and shutdown times on chart record

   e. Monitor system operation by reviewing status lights and radioactivity levels

   d. Turn BEAM PORT PURGE valve control switch to OFF position

ABNORMAL CONDITIONS
-------------------

A. Airborne radioactivity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Alert airborne radioactivity level:**

The alert condition does not require an operator action.  
Actuation of the alert condition may provide an indication of system function.  
Alert levels are a warning of a potential for excessive occupational concentrations.

- ≥ 4000 cpm air particulate monitor  
  *May occur from natural causes*

- ≥ 2000 cpm argon-41 gaseous monitor  
  *Normally occurs above 100 kilowatts*

**High airborne radioactivity level**

This condition requires automatic and other operator actions.  
Evaluation of sources and levels are necessary to quantify any effluent releases.

- ≥ 10,000 cpm air particulate monitor  
  *Reactor activation product*  
  *Fission product decay product*

- ≥ 10,000 cpm argon-41 gaseous monitor  
  *Excessive argon-41 release*  
  *Fission product gas release*

1. Perform emergency shutdown of HVAC System:

   a. Move the HVAC ISOLATION switch to ISOLATE.  
   b. Verify SUPPLY DAMPER indicates CLOSED.  
      Verify RETURN DAMPER indicates CLOSED.  
   c. Turn REACTOR FAN SYSTEM switch to REACTOR OFF.  
   d. Verify SUPPLY FAN ON lamp extinguishes.  
      Verify RETURN FAN ON lamp extinguishes.

2. Verify Argon Purge System is shutdown.  
   Verify PURGE FAN ON lamp extinguished.

3. Push the EMERGENCY ALARM switch on Control Room Panel (CRP).  
   Switch initiates audible sound for evacuation of reactor room area.  
   Room evacuation is a requirement if an airborne personnel hazard exists.

4. Notify SRO and HP of airborne radioactivity conditions.

5. SRO and/or HP determine whether to:

   - Retrieve CAM filter(s) for verification of High Airborne condition, or  
   - Align Argon Purge System with portable line to sample room air on Ar⁴¹ CAM filter, and  
   - Replace filters on the accessed CAMs with new filters.

6. Do not restart HVAC system or Argon purge system.  
   Evaluate airborne activity and isotopes by analysis of the CAM’s filter(s).  
   Determine whether an airborne radioactivity emergency exists.  
   If so, determine operation requirements and procedure requirements.

7. Review emergency response plan.  
   Determine if leak condition is an emergency classification in PLAN-E.  
   Implement emergency response plan procedures, if applicable.  

   - In general, isolation of the room will be sufficient.  
   - Refer to PLAN-E and PLAN-O notification requirements.

8. Recovery from an unanticipated abnormal airborne radioactivity release and/or the controlled release of any abnormal airborne radioactivity requires two approvals:

   - Supervisory Reactor Operator approval, and  
   - Radiation Safety Officer approval.

   Approvals exclude the normal effluent release of argon-41.  
   Refer to Emergency operation of Argon Purge only if filtered exhaust is approved.  
   Refer to surveillance procedure for HVAC system startup.  
   Refer to SURV-5 to startup from ISOLATE condition.

B. HVAC System
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

HVAC system failure does not require immediate reactor shutdown provided the  
Argon Purge System is operating or corrective action in progress.  
Room confinement dampers must be operational or corrective action in progress.  
Airborne particulate radioactivity concentrations must be within limits.  
(Limit is 2E-9 μCi/cm³ (≥10,000 cpm) on air particulate monitor in laboratory).
