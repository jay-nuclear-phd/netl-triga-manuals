INTRODUCTION
------------

A. Purpose
^^^^^^^^^^
To provide for classification of emergency conditions and describe the general actions to be taken for each Emergency Classification Category.

B. Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This procedure provides the general guidelines for classification and actions to be taken in event of an emergency condition. The guidance provided in this procedure is very general as each emergency is an unpredictable and unique event. The specific actions taken are left to the personnel in charge based on their assessment of the event and the circumstances.

C. Schedule
^^^^^^^^^^^
Apply for each occurrence of an emergency event.

PROCEDURE
---------

A. Classification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Use information in Attachment A, Emergency Classification, to classify the event as a:  
   a. Non-Reactor Specific Event  
   b. Notification of Unusual Event

2. Place call for assistance, and start notification process (see procedure PLAN 0).

3. Follow the procedures of section B or C. If evacuation is necessary follow the procedures of section D.


B. Actions for Non-Reactor Specific Event
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Evacuation of the building would not normally be a requirement of this classification of event.*

1. The reactor shall be immediately shutdown if the event or emergency has the potential to worsen such that the reactor, pool, room, experiments or instrumentation and control system are threatened.

2. Render immediate assistance to any victim.

3. Secure radioactive materials as necessary.

4. Notify all persons in the immediate areas.

5. Identify the responsible person to be designated emergency director.

6. Request assistance from appropriate emergency response organizations. (Refer to Call List.)

7. Notify and/or verify notification of University Radiation Safety Officer and the NETL Director.

8. Initiate actions that mitigate the emergency situation.

9. Take actions necessary to terminate emergency condition.


C. Actions for Notification of Unusual Event
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Evacuation of the building or an area may be a requirement of this classification of event.*

1. Terminate reactor operation by normal shutdown or scram switch, if appropriate.

2. Notify and evacuate all persons in the immediate vicinity.

3. Specify the responsible emergency director by verbal acknowledgement:  
   a. Reactor Supervisor  
   b. Supervisory Reactor Operator  
   c. Health Physicist  
   d. Facility Director or his designee

4. Notify appropriate emergency response organizations. (Refer to Call List)

5. Secure appropriate emergency equipment. Locate appropriate emergency supplies. (Refer to Emergency Equipment and Supplies List)

6. Initiate actions to mitigate the emergency.

7. Identify need for emergency support.

8. Notify university safety and security personnel.

9. Provide security and access control.

10. Assess radiation levels and releases.

11. Implement controls to limit personnel exposures appropriately. Establish controls for radioactive material contamination.

12. Evacuate personnel on adjacent site areas if necessary.

13. Notify NRC and Texas Department of State Health Services Radiation Control Program. (Refer to Emergency Call List)

14. Maintain physical security, and radiological monitoring until event is terminated.

15. Take actions necessary to terminate emergency condition.

16. Review facility status and develop recovery procedures.


D. Area Evacuation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Proceed to the emergency assembly area. An alternate area may be designated if the assembly area is not considered safe.

   a. Assembly area is the health physics room (2.106). For localized emergencies that do not threaten the building systems or multiple building areas.  
   b. Alternate areas are the NETL Annex, or parking area near the entrance to the NETL equipment access driveway. If these areas are downwind, the emergency director shall locate another site upwind of the building, visible to arriving emergency responders, and verbally notify all evacuees.  
   c. Account for all persons in the facility. A person should monitor the whereabouts of facility personnel at both the main and service exits to the building.  
   d. Determine the person specified as emergency director. Assign a person to provide public information.  
   e. NETL Emergency Director should wear a hard-hat and/or fluorescent vest with NETL-Emergency director designation.  
   f. NETL Emergency Director should communicate with HP or staff personnel using two way communication equipment, such as radio or portable phone, or by relay via response personnel communication equipment.

2. Control spread of radioactive contamination by:  
   a. Immediate measurement of activity on hands and feet  
   b. Removal of contaminated clothing and washing of skin surfaces  
   c. Identification of potential problem areas  
   d. Control of access to hazard areas

3. Remove readily accessible portable radiation survey instruments to be available for emergency activities. Issue pocket dosimeters to emergency personnel entering potential radiation areas.

4. Persons transported from the area for medical treatment shall be free of contamination or escorted by a knowledgeable person with radioactivity measurement equipment.

5. Avoid areas with potential safety hazards.
