OPER-1 Startup-Shutdown Checks
====================================

I. Introduction
----------------

A. Purpose
^^^^^^^^^^

This procedure describe the facility and reactor system checks to be done prior to startup of the reactor and subsequent to shutdown of the reactor including a check of operation requests for valid experiments.

B. Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Opeation of the reactor requires test and verification of Instrumentation Control and Safety (ICS) System functions and other facility systems.
Checklists for the test and verification of ICS System and checks of support systems assure that systems are operable prior to or during operation of the reactor.

Several facility systems must function properly for the reactor systems to operate safely. The two most important are the pool water system and air confinement system. Other equipment such as communication equipment and radiation monitoring equipment are also necessary for operation. A checklist documents the status of various systems. Both pre-start checks and post shutdown checks are for the purpose of verifying the operability or condition of important systems.

Prior to actual operation, a review of the operation requirements and check of valid experiment requests and approvals must be made. An operation request form documents the request and the valid experiment approval. All actions of this procedure require the direct supervision of a reactor operator with a valid license.

C. Schedule
^^^^^^^^^^^

Apply this procedure each day the reactor is taken through an operation cycle of startup and shutdown.

II. Procedure
----------------

Review the requirements of operation (see section A). Prior to the day's operation perform the startup checks (refer to section B). At the conclusion of the day's operation perform the shutdown checks (refer to section C).

Review the requirements of operation (see section A). Prior to the day's operation perform the startup checks (refer to section B). At the conclusion of the day's operation perform the shutdown checks (refer to section C).

A. Operation Request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Review the operation request form for each experiment.

1. Review each operation and experiment to document a valid experiment approval authorization has been done. The Reactor Supervisor (SRO in his absence) shall approve the operation request.

2. Active operation request forms should be available at the reactor console during all reactor operations for that request.

3. The operation requests include an evaluation of samples or materials subject to irradiation or exposure and a list of samples on a form such as HP6 Sample Logs. These forms should be kept with the operation request until the irradiation or exposure is complete.

4. Place operation requests that are no longer active in the appropriate permanent files.

B. Startup Checks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Perform the following actions and record data on the Startup-Shutdown Checklist.

1. Identify experiment classification and personnel requirements:
   
   a. Perform visual inspection of reactor and experiment areas.  
   b. Review the operation request (see section A).  
   c. Designate the SRO, RO and experimenter, if any.

2. Check support facility conditions;
   Several systems must be operating or operable.

   a. Room 1.104 Evacuation Alarm  
   b. Communication - telephone and intercom (1 way)  
      Telephone must be operating at the time of startup.  
   c. Operate the following radiation monitoring systems:  
      i. Air particulate activity monitor.  
      ii. Argon-41 gas effluent activity monitor.  
      iii. Area radiation monitors (at least 3); the pool area monitor and two additional area monitors must be operating.

3. Set reactor room ventilation conditions, as follows:

   a. Switch room HVAC fan to “Reactor ON” mode (refer to OPER-5).  
      “Reactor ON” mode of the HVAC system should be the normal mode during operation of the reactor.  
   b. Start argon purge fan and align source valves ON (refer to OPER-5).  
      This system must be operating if the “Reactor ON” mode of the HVAC is not available and the reactor is operating.

4. Set reactor pool cooling conditions, as required:

   a. Note status of water purification loop. Pool water purification system should be operating (refer to OPER-4).  
   b. Operate heat exchanger coolant system pool and chilled water loops for requested reactor power levels greater than 100 kilowatts (refer to OPER-4).  
      Under normal conditions the cooling system should be operating prior to reactor startup.  
      Use primary checklist for first system startup and last shutdown of the day.  
      Use supplemental cooling system checklist for intermittent shutdown and restarts.

5. Check operability of ICS System (requires SRO approval):

   a. Verify ICS operating or initiate ICS bootstrap sequence.  
      Refer to Chapter 1 & 2 of ICS Operation Manual.  
   b. Verify successful ICS bootstrap sequence.  
      Refer to Chapter 2 of ICS Operation Manual.  
   c. Perform ICS Pre-start checks sequence.  
      Refer to Chapter 2 of ICS Operation Manual.

6. Check operability of support and experiment systems.
   (Checklists require SRO approval)

   a. Complete Startup Checklist.  
   b. Complete any (applicable) Experiment Systems Checklist.

C. Shutdown Checks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Verify the following tasks are complete. Record on the Startup-Shutdown checklist.

1. Turn Reactor Control Console (RCC) key switch from ON to OFF.  
   Perform operator log OFF.

2. Remove and secure RCC key (give to SRO/place in locked storage).

3. Secure experiment areas, radiation areas, and radioactive materials.

4. Complete shutdown checklist:

   a. Secure operation of heat exchanger system (refer to OPER-4)  
      i. Turn OFF power to pool water and chiller water pumps.  
      ii. Close chilled water valves to heat exchanger (2) and the pool water isolation valves (3).

   b. Secure operation of room ventilation exhaust (refer to OPER-5)  
      i. Turn off argon purge fan and close source valves.  
      ii. Record integral Argon counts and secure Argon CAM.  
      iii. Switch room HVAC fan mode from “Reactor ON” to “Reactor OFF”.

   c. Perform inspection of reactor and experiment areas.

5. File previous operation records, checklists, and other data-sheets.
