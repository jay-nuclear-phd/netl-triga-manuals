   5. Reactor systems test equipment (marked "RX") is not shop test equipment and should only be used for reactor work. Stored on labeled shelf in Control Room Closet 3.208B.

   6. Return all tools and electronic equipment to normal storage and clean up your area. Any item not returned must be logged on the equipment checkout list.

NETL-2 OPEN FLAME USE
=====================

I. PURPOSE
----------

   This document details the procedures for use of open flame devices in the NETL Facility.

II. DISCUSSION
--------------

   Operation and safety procedures are required in all facilities to establish efficient work practices while providing for the protection of both personnel and equipment. Based on these criteria, specific procedures were developed for the use of open flame devices within the NETL building. The procedure is designed to minimize false fire alarms, prevent fire ignition from open flame devices, and provide notifications of hazardous activities.

   This procedure does not authorize any work that may involve radioactive materials. An RWP is required for work with radioactive materials.

   Open Flame Use

V. INSTRUCTIONS
---------------

   The use of welding equipment and cutting torches in any area of the building is subject to all the restrictions of this procedure. The use of Bunsen burners in laboratory areas is also subject to the following rules:

   1. Request approval to perform the activity involving open flame from the Manager of Operations and Maintenance.  
      Bunsen burner applications in fume hoods may also be authorized by the Manager of Nuclear Analytical Services.

   2. Identify the location and types of fire protection system sensors (smoke or heat) in the area where the activity is planned.  
      Remember that there are also smoke detectors in the ventilation system ducts.

   3. Review the possible response of the building fire protection system to the open flame and the potential production of smoke.  
      If necessary, U.T. Physical Plant Automated Systems personnel can secure one of the fire protection system zones to prevent an alarm during the planned activity.

   4. Notify the Emergency Director, NETL Director, or Reactor Supervisor prior to the initiation of any open flame activity.  
      One person other than the person approving the work should be aware of the time and location of the planned activities.

   5. Remove all moveable combustible materials from the immediate area in which the open flame will be used.

   6. Note the location of the nearest fire extinguisher.  
      Verify that it is charged and the appropriate type for use in extinguishing combustibles present in the area.

   7. A person on the NETL staff must continuously be present and ready to take any corrective actions warranted while a flame is burning.  
      No flame should be left unattended.

   8. After the activity is complete, make sure no smoldering materials remain and return all conditions including fire protection system status to normal.

NETL-3 Liquid Radiactive Waste System
=====================================

I. PURPOSE
----------

   To specify the requirements for operation of the Liquid Radioactive Waste (LW) system.

II. DISCUSSION
--------------

   The LW system is used to collect and store radioactive waste from two laboratory sinks, the safety shower, and the eyewash.  
   This procedure specifies the requirements and operation of the system to ensure its safe and proper use.

   The normal input points to the system are the laboratory counter sinks in rooms 3.102 and 3.106.  
   Drainage of the safety shower and eyewash, both located in the adjacent hallway, is into a holding tank (100 gallons),  
   which may drain into the system if an emergency requires holding of the shower and eyewash wastewater for analysis.

   Discharges from the system cannot be directed to the sanitary waste system until a temporary spoolpiece is installed.  
   Analysis of any tank contents is necessary prior to connection to the sanitary wastewater system.

NETL-5 Specialized Work Permit
==============================

I. INTRODUCTION
---------------

A. PURPOSE
~~~~~~~~~~

   This procedure identifies and defines the general requirements for, and administration of,  
   Specialized Work Permits (SWP) for the Nuclear Engineering Teaching Laboratory (NETL).

B. DESCRIPTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The Specialized Work Permit is an administrative control used at the NETL which is  
   implemented to control special processes or experiments. The purpose is to protect both  
   unique NETL equipment and/or experiment systems from damage resulting from improper use  
   and to protect facility users including faculty, staff, students, and visitors from potential  
   personal hazards including physical injury or radiation exposures above established ALARA levels.  
   A SWP is issued for situations where there is a specific procedure or process that must be  
   learned and understood by users to safely conduct the work.

   The SWP establishes the framework for safely and effectively managing special work processes  
   at NETL. It includes sections for approval of trained individuals, a set of procedural instructions  
   listing key steps, and must be kept in the area where work or experiments are performed for  
   reference.

C. SCHEDULE
~~~~~~~~~~~

   Apply daily as necessary for execution of special processes or experiments.  
   Review and retrain users or revise procedures based on lessons learned.

II. PROCEDURE
-------------

.. _NETL-5.II.A:

A. Requirements for Issue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   A SWP must be established to work under the following conditions:

   1. Approved Experiments requiring or referring to a SWP.  
   2. Approved Experiments initially requiring an RWP, where the ALARA Committee approves conversion to a SWP.  
   3. Other processes as specified by the Reactor Supervisor, Lab Manager, or Health Physicist.

.. _NETL-5.II.B:

B. SWPs for Proposed or Approved Experiments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Procedure ADMN 6 describes the process for experiment authorization.  
   If a proposed experiment requires a SWP, a draft should be completed and submitted.  
   If initially an RWP was used and the process is well-characterized, it may be converted to a SWP  
   with ALARA Committee approval. This change must be reported to the Reactor Oversight Committee.

.. _NETL-5.II.C:

C. Administration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   1. The individual in charge of the activity or task is responsible for requesting a new SWP and should complete sections A through D of the SWP. Discussion of the task with the Reactor Supervisor, Laboratory Manager, and if appropriate the Health Physicist should occur during this phase.

   2. The proposed SWP along with an attached work procedure is submitted to the Reactor Supervisor and Lab Manager for review and approval. If the Proposed SWP is to replace a RWP then the proposed SWP is also reviewed by the ALARA Committee. The Facility Director shall be the designated member of the ALARA Committee to sign the SWP approval. If the radiation levels and exposures associated with the work are anticipated to be higher than the thresholds specified for an RWP then an RWP may be required instead of an SWP.

   3. The SWP is assigned a SWP number or letter designation and placed in a conspicuous folder. The initial list of individuals authorized to work under the SWP is designated at the time of initial issue.

   4. The approved SWP including any revisions to the work procedure is returned to the initiator who signs the SWP Briefing Log to indicate acknowledgement of the work conditions and requirements. The initiator then shall place the SWP folder in or near the area where the work described is to be carried out.

   5. SWPs are normally issued for an unspecified time period and do not expire unless the work covered by the SWP is permanently discontinued. Revisions and updates to a SWP and associated procedure will be made based on experience and lessons learned.

   6. The person in charge of the work (SWP initiator) is responsible for ensuring that all personnel who will be working under the SWP have received appropriate training for the prescribed work process and have read and signed the SWP.

   7. All personnel who work under an SWP shall read the SWP and indicate acceptance and understanding of the conditions by signing the SWP. Individuals working under a SWP shall notify personnel in adjacent areas of potential hazards of the work and enforce the requirements of the SWP. Note: Failure to follow the provisions of an SWP will result in withdrawal of SWP work privileges.

   8. Each person who works under an SWP which specifies required pocket dosimeters shall periodically check their pocket dosimeter reading.

   9. The SWP for a task shall be kept near, but not necessarily inside, the work area.

   10. Any individual performing work under an SWP which encounters circumstances or a situation which is unexpected or abnormal shall immediately cease the activity in progress, place the work area in a secure condition, and notify the Reactor Supervisor, the Health Physicist, or the Laboratory Manager, before proceeding with further work.

   11. The Reactor Supervisor and/or Laboratory Manager may periodically observe individuals working under a SWP and review compliance to the established controls and procedures. Failure to follow the provisions of an SWP may result in withdrawal of SWP work privileges.

   12. The SWP Initiator, Reactor Supervisor, or Laboratory Manager may make additions to the list of persons authorized to work under a SWP. Individuals added to a SWP must receive training and demonstrate familiarity with the work procedure prior to being allowed to perform the work alone. Approval of the Reactor Supervisor or Lab Manager is required for added individuals to allow verification of the level of training of the person(s) working under any SWP. Visitors will not normally be allowed to perform work governed by an SWP. If a visitor requires entry to a situation in which a SWP has been issued, verbal approval by the Reactor Supervisor or Lab Manager is required. The approved visitor must be continuously escorted by an individual authorized to work under the SWP.

   13. If work under the SWP results in the relocation of materials resulting or causing a new radiation area or is suspected to have surface contaminated an area or object, the area should be marked appropriately and/or swiped for loose contamination prior to personnel working under the SWP exiting for the day. The person(s) working under the SWP are responsible for marking the area and/or conducting swipes or requesting assistance from health physics staff.

   The swipes of any suspect area may be evaluated by direct frisk (remember to account for instrument efficiency) or be taken to the Health Physics laboratory for analysis. If the Health Physicist or technician is not in the laboratory, the swipes should be left at a location as designated by the health physics staff. The swipes should be clearly labeled on the swipe envelope and attached to an area survey map.

   All personnel who have been in a SWP where there was suspected exposure to surface contamination should perform a hand and foot frisk using available portable instruments when leaving the work area and should utilize the hand and foot monitor prior to leaving the building.

.. _NETL-5.II.D:

D. Records
~~~~~~~~~~

   1. A reference original copy of each SWP will be kept in the reactor control room. The working copy should be in the area where the work is performed. Periodically the reference copy will be compared with the working copy and if additions or changes are suggested in the working copy they will be updated in the reference copy. Hand written notes or comments other than the addition and approval of individuals authorized to work under the SWP are not an official part of the SWP unless initialed by at least one of the same individuals who initially signed to approve the SWP. Periodically if handwritten notes and approvals become numerous, the SWP can be reissued incorporating the approved corrections.
