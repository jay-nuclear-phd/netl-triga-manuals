OPER-1 Startup-Shutdown Checks
====================================

I. Introduction
===============

A. Purpose
----------

This procedure describe the facility and reactor system checks to be done prior to startup of the reactor and subsequent to shutdown of the reactor including a check of operation requests for valid experiments.

B. Description
--------------

Opeation of the reactor requires test and verification of Instrumentation Control and Safety (ICS) System functions and other facility systems.
Checklists for the test and verification of ICS System and checks of support systems assure that systems are operable prior to or during operation of the reactor.

Several facility systems must function properly for the reactor systems to operate safely. The two most important are the pool water system and air confinement system. Other equipment such as communication equipment and radiation monitoring equipment are also necessary for operation. A checklist documents the status of various systems. Both pre-start checks and post shutdown checks are for the purpose of verifying the operability or condition of important systems.

Prior to actual operation, a review of the operation requirements and check of valid experiment requests and approvals must be made. An operation request form documents the request and the valid experiment approval. All actions of this procedure require the direct supervision of a reactor operator with a valid license.

C. Schedule
-----------

Apply this procedure each day the reactor is taken through an operation cycle of startup and shutdown.

II. Procedure
=============

Review the requirements of operation (see section A). Prior to the day's operation perform the startup checks (refer to section B). At the conclusion of the day's operation perform the shutdown checks (refer to section C).

Review the requirements of operation (see section A). Prior to the day's operation perform the startup checks (refer to section B). At the conclusion of the day's operation perform the shutdown checks (refer to section C).

A. Operation Request
--------------------

Review the operation request form for each experiment.

1. Review each operation and experiment to document a valid experiment approval authorization has been done. The Reactor Supervisor (SRO in his absence) shall approve the operation request.

2. Active operation request forms should be available at the reactor console during all reactor operations for that request.

3. The operation requests include an evaluation of samples or materials subject to irradiation or exposure and a list of samples on a form such as HP6 Sample Logs. These forms should be kept with the operation request until the irradiation or exposure is complete.

4. Place operation requests that are no longer active in the appropriate permanent files.

B. Startup Checks
-----------------

Perform the following actions and record data on the Startup-Shutdown Checklist.

1. Identify experiment classification and personnel requirements:
   
   a. Perform visual inspection of reactor and experiment areas.  
   b. Review the operation request (see section A).  
   c. Designate the SRO, RO and experimenter, if any.
