NETL-2 OPEN FLAME USE
=====================

PURPOSE
-------

This document details the procedures for use of open flame devices in the NETL Facility.

DISCUSSION
----------

Operation and safety procedures are required in all facilities to establish efficient work practices while providing for the protection of both personnel and equipment. Based on these criteria, specific procedures were developed for the use of open flame devices within the NETL building.  
The procedure is designed to minimize false fire alarms, prevent fire ignition from open flame devices, and provide notifications of hazardous activities.

This procedure does not authorize any work that may involve radioactive materials. An RWP is required for work with radioactive materials.

INSTRUCTIONS
------------

The use of welding equipment and cutting torches in any area of the building is subject to all the restrictions of this procedure.  
The use of Bunsen burners in laboratory areas is also subject to the following rules:

1. **Request approval** to perform the activity involving open flame from the **Manager of Operations and Maintenance**.  
   Bunsen burner applications in fume hoods may also be authorized by the **Manager of Nuclear Analytical Services**.

2. **Identify** the location and types of **fire protection system sensors** (smoke or heat) in the area where the activity is planned.  
   Remember that there are also smoke detectors in the **ventilation system ducts**.

3. **Review** the possible response of the building fire protection system to the open flame and the potential production of smoke.  
   If necessary, U.T. Physical Plant Automated Systems personnel can secure one of the fire protection system zones to prevent an alarm during the planned activity.

4. **Notify** the Emergency Director, NETL Director, or Reactor Supervisor **prior to the initiation** of any open flame activity.  
   One person other than the person approving the work should be aware of the **time and location** of the planned activities.

5. **Remove all moveable combustible materials** from the immediate area in which the open flame will be used.

6. **Note** the location of the **nearest fire extinguisher**.  
   Verify that it is **charged** and the appropriate type for use in extinguishing combustibles present in the area.

7. A person on the NETL staff **must continuously be present** and ready to take any corrective actions warranted while a flame is burning.  
   **No flame should be left unattended.**

8. After the activity is complete, **make sure no smoldering materials remain** and **return all conditions including fire protection system status to normal**.

NETL-3 Liquid Radiactive Waste System
=====================================

PURPOSE
-------

To specify the requirements for operation of the Liquid Radioactive Waste (LW) system.

DISCUSSION
----------

The LW system is used to collect and store radioactive waste from two laboratory sinks, the safety shower, and the eyewash.  
This procedure specifies the requirements and operation of the system to ensure its safe and proper use.

The normal input points to the system are the laboratory counter sinks in rooms 3.102 and 3.106.  
Drainage of the safety shower and eyewash, both located in the adjacent hallway, is into a holding tank (100 gallons),  
which may drain into the system if an emergency requires holding of the shower and eyewash wastewater for analysis.

Discharges from the system cannot be directed to the sanitary waste system until a temporary spoolpiece is installed.  
**Analysis of any tank contents is necessary prior to connection to the sanitary wastewater system.**

NETL-5 Specialized Work Permit
==============================

INTRODUCTION
------------

A. PURPOSE
~~~~~~~~~~

This procedure identifies and defines the general requirements for, and administration of,  
Specialized Work Permits (SWP) for the Nuclear Engineering Teaching Laboratory (NETL).

B. DESCRIPTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Specialized Work Permit is an administrative control used at the NETL which is  
implemented to control special processes or experiments. The purpose is to protect both  
unique NETL equipment and/or experiment systems from damage resulting from improper use  
and to protect facility users including faculty, staff, students, and visitors from potential  
personal hazards including physical injury or radiation exposures above established ALARA levels.  
A SWP is issued for situations where there is a specific procedure or process that must be  
learned and understood by users to safely conduct the work.

The SWP establishes the framework for safely and effectively managing special work processes  
at NETL. It includes sections for approval of trained individuals, a set of procedural instructions  
listing key steps, and must be kept in the area where work or experiments are performed for  
reference.

C. SCHEDULE
~~~~~~~~~~~

Apply daily as necessary for execution of special processes or experiments.  
Review and retrain users or revise procedures based on lessons learned.

1. NETL HP Procedures as required  
2. Procedure ADMN 6, Authorization of Experiments  
3. Applicable approved Experiment Authorizations  

PROCEDURE
---------

A. Requirements for Issue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A SWP must be established to work under the following conditions:

1. Approved Experiments requiring or referring to a SWP.  
2. Approved Experiments initially requiring an RWP, where the ALARA Committee approves conversion to a SWP.  
3. Other processes as specified by the Reactor Supervisor, Lab Manager, or Health Physicist.

B. SWPs for Proposed or Approved Experiments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Procedure ADMN 6 describes the process for experiment authorization.  
If a proposed experiment requires a SWP, a draft should be completed and submitted.  
If initially an RWP was used and the process is well-characterized, it may be converted to a SWP  
with ALARA Committee approval. This change must be reported to the Reactor Oversight Committee.

C. Administration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. The person responsible for the activity must complete sections A-D of the SWP and consult with appropriate authorities.  
2. The proposed SWP and work procedure is reviewed by the Reactor Supervisor and Lab Manager.  
   If replacing an RWP, it must be reviewed by the ALARA Committee and signed by the Facility Director.  
3. Assign an SWP number/letter and list authorized individuals.  
4. The approved SWP (including revisions) is returned to the initiator and logged.  
5. SWPs are typically open-ended unless work is discontinued.  
6. The initiator ensures all participants have received training and signed the SWP.  
7. All personnel must read and sign the SWP and be informed of hazards.  
8. Individuals using pocket dosimeters must check readings periodically.  
9. Keep the SWP near the work area.  
10. If unexpected or abnormal situations occur, stop work, secure the area, and notify responsible personnel.  
11. The Reactor Supervisor/Lab Manager may observe SWP work to ensure compliance.  
12. Additions to the SWP user list must be approved. Visitors generally cannot perform SWP work.  
13. If SWP work causes contamination:  
    - Mark/survey the area  
    - Swipes may be taken and analyzed by HP staff  
    - Perform hand/foot frisk before exiting

D. Records
~~~~~~~~~~

1. A reference copy of each SWP is kept in the Reactor Control Room.  
   - The working copy is kept at the work location.  
   - If there are changes or notes, they must be approved.  
   - If changes become numerous, reissue the SWP with approved corrections.
