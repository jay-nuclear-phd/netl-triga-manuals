<h3>A. Purpose<a class="headerlink" href="#a-purpose" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The Reactor Startup, Operating and Shutdown procedure specifies actions to be completed for startup, operating and shutdown of the reactor. This new procedure is a combination of the old OPER 2 (Reactor Startup and Shutdown) and OPER 3 (Reactor Operations Mode).</p>
</section>
<section id="b-description">
<h3>B. Description<a class="headerlink" href="#b-description" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Actions for the Reactor Startup, Operating and Shutdown require certain specific conditions. Prior to startup, the correct operating conditions are verified by the performance of a Startup Checklist. Following the final Reactor Shutdown of the day, a Shutdown Checklist is performed to place all secondary and supportive systems in their post operating mode and required data is annotated. Logs will be taken in a hand written or computer form, whichever is determined by the reactor manager.</p>
<p>Guidance for startup and operation of the reactor is available in the operator’s manual. Features of the procedure provide requirements and guidance.</p>
<p>All actions of this procedure require the direct supervision of a reactor operator with a valid license. Abnormal shutdown or SCRAMS require a SRO approval prior to restart of the reactor.</p>
</section>
<section id="c-schedule">
<h3>C. Schedule<a class="headerlink" href="#c-schedule" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Apply this procedure each day the reactor is taken through an operation cycle of a startup, operating mode and shutdown.</p>

<p>The Reactor startup can be performed in various modes. Ensure that you review the correct mode for the startup you will be performing. Ensure all corresponding requirements have been completed and that a current Startup Checklist has been performed.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Review operation procedure for the mode of operations you will be conducting.
The Console Log, whether paper or electronic, will record operator comments regarding important system conditions.
These log sheets will supplement computer printouts from the ICS system.
Other data sheets such as the Operation Request, Startup-Shutdown Checklist and Reactivity Calculation Sheet complete normal documentation for a typical run.</p></li>
<li><p>Review completion of the Startup Checklist and note the recorded conditions.
If this is a startup after the initial startup of the day, verify the startup checklist was completed and monitor system indications to ensure that no lineups have been altered since the reactor was last operating.
Review any Night Order Log comments that are new since the last time you operated the reactor.
If a problem occurs at the time of reactor startup or shutdown, place a comment in the Console Log and ensure the Senior Reactor Operator is informed.
Additionally, record any abnormal indications.
If questions exist regarding acceptability of operating conditions, consult the Senior Reactor Operator on watch or the Reactor Manager.</p></li>
<li><p>Verify the control room door is closed and the required licensed operators are signed in to log with line stating the relieved and relieving operators in the comment section.
If this is not the initial startup, ensure SRO permission to conduct startup of reactor and obtain required power.
The minimum staffing requirements are:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>Normal operations: SRO/RO, with second person in building (SRO must be available).
Second person signature required in logs after 1730.</p></li>
<li><p>Initial Startup: Requirements of II.3.a. and SRO present (SRO may be the second person in the building).</p></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Note: If startup is following a SCRAM, condition of SCRAM must be identified, and SRO approval to startup obtained.
SRO must sign and date SCRAM log entry.</em>
<em>(If verbal approval over phone for startup after SCRAM is given, it must be noted in logs and SCRAM log entry signed as soon as SRO returns to facility).</em></p>
</li>
<li><p>Perform operator log on function.</p></li>
<li><p>Determine desired mode of operation. Review Typical Startup and Operating Sequences (Section II.B.).</p>
<p><em>Note: A log (capture of Status Window) should be taken by pressing F2 after each power change and approximately every 30 minutes during steady state operation.
Verification that the reactor area radiation monitoring system is operating correctly should be performed at this time and annotated in the Console Log.</em></p>
</li>
<li><p>When operations are complete, perform shutdown procedures. (Refer to Section II.C.)</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>B. Typical Startup and Operating Sequences<a class="headerlink" href="#b-typical-startup-and-operating-sequences" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The Manual and Auto Modes start with the Manual Mode procedure.
When the required power is obtained, the Mode is shifted to Auto.
Rod positions increment from 0 to 960 (equal to a span of 15 inches).
The initial startup requires an excess Reactivity Configuration at 50 watts.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Manual Mode: (Refer to Chapter 4 of Control Console Operator’s Manual)</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>Withdraw transient rod to approximately 50% withdrawn position or position of previous startup of the day or previous startup of similar experiments and burn up.</p></li>
<li><p>Withdraw Regulating rod to similar position as transient rod.</p></li>
<li><p>Withdraw each shim rod in steps of 50 units or less alternating shim rods.</p></li>
<li><p>Monitor period and maintain as close to 20 seconds as possible while not going less than 10 seconds.</p></li>
<li><p>Adjust each rod to maintain period as in 1.d., attempt to maintain bank with rods.</p></li>
<li><p>Take a pause at 50W to verify rod heights are similar to those of latest Reactivity Configuration calculation and days history of operation.</p></li>
<li><p>Adjust rods to stabilize power level at desired level.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Auto Mode: (Refer to Chapter 5 of Control Console Operator’s Manual)</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>Set power demand to desired power.</p></li>
<li><p>Follow procedure for Manual Mode.</p></li>
<li><p>Press Auto Mode Switch when desired power is reached.</p></li>
<li><p>Adjust rod heights to a bank position for best operation.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Square Wave Mode: (Refer to Chapter 5 of Control Console Operator’s Manual)</p>
<p><em>Note: Testing has proven that maximum Square wave should be limited to 500kW.</em></p>
<p>a) Sequences for square wave mode operation use transient rod (TR) positions that create a positive reactivity insertion as the rod moves from 0 to set position associated with the amount of reactivity desired to achieve desired power.
At the time of actuation of the fire button, the core will be set at a steady state power less than 1 kW (testing has proven the best results occur with initial power set at 800 Watts).</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="lowerroman simple">
<li><p>Choose desired amount of reactivity to add from the movement of TR. (Amount added cannot be greater than 1 dollar (&lt; $1.00). ($0.90 has proven during testing to be the best amount to add for square waves greater than 200kW)</p></li>
<li><p>From TR rod worth data determine the rod position associated with the desired reactivity addition.</p></li>
<li><p>Compare estimated values with previous results if possible.</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<ol class="loweralpha simple" start="2">
<li><p>Obtain steady state (SS) power on REG, shim 1 and shim 2, 800 watts is typical (&lt;1kW):</p>
<ol class="lowerroman simple">
<li><p>Withdraw REG rod to approximately 50% withdrawn position.</p></li>
<li><p>Withdraw each shim rod in steps of 50 units or less.</p></li>
<li><p>Monitor period and maintain as close to 20 seconds as possible while not going less than 10 seconds.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not exceed 10-second period.</p></li>
<li><p>Stabilize power by moving shim rods into a banked position while leaving REG rod at approximately 50% withdrawn position.
(This will prevent REG rod from reaching its fully withdrawn position during square wave transient operations.)</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Initiate Square Wave:</p>
<ol class="lowerroman simple">
<li><p>Verify transient rod is at 0% position.</p></li>
<li><p>Check rod at low limit, turn air pressure off.</p></li>
<li><p>Withdraw drive cylinder to position determined in 3.a.ii above.</p></li>
<li><p>Check power &lt;1kW. Place in manual mode.</p></li>
<li><p>Set Demand Power thumbwheels to desired SS power.</p></li>
<li><p>Press Square Wave Switch. Verify SQUARE WAVE light illuminates and console system mode is SQUARE WAVE READY.</p></li>
<li><p>Press Fire switch. (System will switch to AUTO mode if demand power is reached in 10 seconds.
System will switch to MANUAL mode if demand power is NOT reached in 10 seconds.)</p></li>
<li><p>Adjust transient rod height as necessary to limit REG rod withdraw due to temperature coefficient effects.</p></li>
<li><p>When power has stabilized, bank rods for BEST performance.</p></li>
<li><p>Take log (F2).</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Pulse Mode: (Refer to Chapter 6 of Control Console Operator’s Manual)</p>
<ol class="loweralpha">
<li><p>Sequences for the pulse mode operation use TR positions that create a positive reactivity insertion as the rod moves from a set position X to 100% WITHDRAWN.
The motion of the control rod will thus cover the full range from 0% to 100%. At the time of actuation of the fire button, the core will be sub-critical by at least one dollar.
Performance following this insertion will be expected to produce a 100% output within 10 milliseconds.
iv.  From TR rod worth curve calculate total reactivity gain for the TR 100% withdrawal position.
v.   Subtract the pulse insertion amount from 100% rod worth. (Maximum allowable Pulse is $3.00)
vi.  Use the final rod worth and determine the initial height of TR rod on the rod worth table.  This is the pre-pulse position of the TR for the initial 50 watt critical condition.
vii. Verify SURV 7 annual comparison pulse is current.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Example: You want to perform a $2.00 pulse. Total rod worth for the TR is 358.077,
358.077 (Trw) - 2.00 (Prw) = 158.077 (Initial rw TR).
Using the rod worth curve this value is equal to a TR height of 410 units.
For the 50W power level, we would then place TR at 410 and bring the remaining rods to the bank height required to obtain 50W.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Obtain steady state power, 50W is typical. (&lt; 1kW):</p>
<ol class="lowerroman simple">
<li><p>Withdraw Transient rod to the position calculated in step 4.a.iii above.</p></li>
<li><p>Withdraw REG rod to approximately 50% withdrawn position.</p></li>
<li><p>Withdraw shim 1 and shim 2 in alternating 50 units or less increments.</p></li>
<li><p>Monitor period and maintain as close to 20 seconds as possible while not going less than 10 seconds.</p></li>
<li><p>Adjust REG, shim 1 and shim 2 rods alternately to maintain period.</p></li>
<li><p>Stabilize power and bank REG, shim 1 and shim 2 rods.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Initiate Pulse Mode:</p>
<ol class="lowerroman simple">
<li><p>Insert TR to 0% position.</p></li>
<li><p>Check TR at low limit, turn air pressure off by pressing yellow air light.</p></li>
<li><p>Withdraw TR drive cylinder to 100% position (960).</p></li>
<li><p>Check power &lt; 1 kW, dpm &lt; +1.</p></li>
<li><p>Press Pulse Mode switch. Verify pulse light illuminates.</p></li>
<li><p>Enter record information for pulse data.</p></li>
<li><p>Verify mode is pulse ready.</p></li>
<li><p>Press Fire switch.</p></li>
<li><p>System will switch to SCRAM mode at conclusion of pulse to display the pulse data.</p></li>
<li><p>Refer to B.1 to return to manual operation. Verify pulse bypass functions are reset to non-pulse conditions:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>Perform SCRAM test on console for Percent 1 and Percent 2 to test reset of bypass relay and reset of gain relay.
Observe decay of pulse power to ensure NM1000 power signal output is functioning.</p></li>
