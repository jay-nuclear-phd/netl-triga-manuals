<h3>A. Purpose<a class="headerlink" href="#a-purpose" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The Reactor Startup, Operating and Shutdown procedure specifies actions to be completed for startup, operating and shutdown of the reactor. This new procedure is a combination of the old OPER 2 (Reactor Startup and Shutdown) and OPER 3 (Reactor Operations Mode).</p>
</section>
<section id="b-description">
<h3>B. Description<a class="headerlink" href="#b-description" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Actions for the Reactor Startup, Operating and Shutdown require certain specific conditions. Prior to startup, the correct operating conditions are verified by the performance of a Startup Checklist. Following the final Reactor Shutdown of the day, a Shutdown Checklist is performed to place all secondary and supportive systems in their post operating mode and required data is annotated. Logs will be taken in a hand written or computer form, whichever is determined by the reactor manager.</p>
<p>Guidance for startup and operation of the reactor is available in the operator’s manual. Features of the procedure provide requirements and guidance.</p>
<p>All actions of this procedure require the direct supervision of a reactor operator with a valid license. Abnormal shutdown or SCRAMS require a SRO approval prior to restart of the reactor.</p>
</section>
<section id="c-schedule">
<h3>C. Schedule<a class="headerlink" href="#c-schedule" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Apply this procedure each day the reactor is taken through an operation cycle of a startup, operating mode and shutdown.</p>
</section>

<h2>II. Procedure<a class="headerlink" href="#ii-procedure" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<section id="a-reactor-startup">
<h3>A. Reactor Startup<a class="headerlink" href="#a-reactor-startup" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The Reactor startup can be performed in various modes. Ensure that you review the correct mode for the startup you will be performing. Ensure all corresponding requirements have been completed and that a current Startup Checklist has been performed.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Review operation procedure for the mode of operations you will be conducting.
The Console Log, whether paper or electronic, will record operator comments regarding important system conditions.
These log sheets will supplement computer printouts from the ICS system.
Other data sheets such as the Operation Request, Startup-Shutdown Checklist and Reactivity Calculation Sheet complete normal documentation for a typical run.</p></li>
<li><p>Review completion of the Startup Checklist and note the recorded conditions.
If this is a startup after the initial startup of the day, verify the startup checklist was completed and monitor system indications to ensure that no lineups have been altered since the reactor was last operating.
Review any Night Order Log comments that are new since the last time you operated the reactor.
If a problem occurs at the time of reactor startup or shutdown, place a comment in the Console Log and ensure the Senior Reactor Operator is informed.
Additionally, record any abnormal indications.
If questions exist regarding acceptability of operating conditions, consult the Senior Reactor Operator on watch or the Reactor Manager.</p></li>
<li><p>Verify the control room door is closed and the required licensed operators are signed in to log with line stating the relieved and relieving operators in the comment section.
If this is not the initial startup, ensure SRO permission to conduct startup of reactor and obtain required power.
The minimum staffing requirements are:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>Normal operations: SRO/RO, with second person in building (SRO must be available).
Second person signature required in logs after 1730.</p></li>
<li><p>Initial Startup: Requirements of II.3.a. and SRO present (SRO may be the second person in the building).</p></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Note: If startup is following a SCRAM, condition of SCRAM must be identified, and SRO approval to startup obtained.
SRO must sign and date SCRAM log entry.</em>
<em>(If verbal approval over phone for startup after SCRAM is given, it must be noted in logs and SCRAM log entry signed as soon as SRO returns to facility).</em></p>
</li>
<li><p>Perform operator log on function.</p></li>
<li><p>Determine desired mode of operation. Review Typical Startup and Operating Sequences (Section II.B.).</p>
<p><em>Note: A log (capture of Status Window) should be taken by pressing F2 after each power change and approximately every 30 minutes during steady state operation.
Verification that the reactor area radiation monitoring system is operating correctly should be performed at this time and annotated in the Console Log.</em></p>
</li>
<li><p>When operations are complete, perform shutdown procedures. (Refer to Section II.C.)</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>B. Typical Startup and Operating Sequences<a class="headerlink" href="#b-typical-startup-and-operating-sequences" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The Manual and Auto Modes start with the Manual Mode procedure.
When the required power is obtained, the Mode is shifted to Auto.
Rod positions increment from 0 to 960 (equal to a span of 15 inches).
The initial startup requires an excess Reactivity Configuration at 50 watts.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Manual Mode: (Refer to Chapter 4 of Control Console Operator’s Manual)</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>Withdraw transient rod to approximately 50% withdrawn position or position of previous startup of the day or previous startup of similar experiments and burn up.</p></li>
<li><p>Withdraw Regulating rod to similar position as transient rod.</p></li>
<li><p>Withdraw each shim rod in steps of 50 units or less alternating shim rods.</p></li>
<li><p>Monitor period and maintain as close to 20 seconds as possible while not going less than 10 seconds.</p></li>
<li><p>Adjust each rod to maintain period as in 1.d., attempt to maintain bank with rods.</p></li>
<li><p>Take a pause at 50W to verify rod heights are similar to those of latest Reactivity Configuration calculation and days history of operation.</p></li>
<li><p>Adjust rods to stabilize power level at desired level.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Auto Mode: (Refer to Chapter 5 of Control Console Operator’s Manual)</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>Set power demand to desired power.</p></li>
<li><p>Follow procedure for Manual Mode.</p></li>
<li><p>Press Auto Mode Switch when desired power is reached.</p></li>
<li><p>Adjust rod heights to a bank position for best operation.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Square Wave Mode: (Refer to Chapter 5 of Control Console Operator’s Manual)</p>
<p><em>Note: Testing has proven that maximum Square wave should be limited to 500kW.</em></p>
<p>a) Sequences for square wave mode operation use transient rod (TR) positions that create a positive reactivity insertion as the rod moves from 0 to set position associated with the amount of reactivity desired to achieve desired power.
At the time of actuation of the fire button, the core will be set at a steady state power less than 1 kW (testing has proven the best results occur with initial power set at 800 Watts).</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="lowerroman simple">
<li><p>Choose desired amount of reactivity to add from the movement of TR. (Amount added cannot be greater than 1 dollar (&lt; $1.00). ($0.90 has proven during testing to be the best amount to add for square waves greater than 200kW)</p></li>
<li><p>From TR rod worth data determine the rod position associated with the desired reactivity addition.</p></li>
<li><p>Compare estimated values with previous results if possible.</p></li>
