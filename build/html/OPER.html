<h4>B. Description<a class="headerlink" href="#b-description" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Opeation of the reactor requires test and verification of Instrumentation Control and Safety (ICS) System functions and other facility systems.
Checklists for the test and verification of ICS System and checks of support systems assure that systems are operable prior to or during operation of the reactor.</p>
<p>Several facility systems must function properly for the reactor systems to operate safely. The two most important are the pool water system and air confinement system. Other equipment such as communication equipment and radiation monitoring equipment are also necessary for operation. A checklist documents the status of various systems. Both pre-start checks and post shutdown checks are for the purpose of verifying the operability or condition of important systems.</p>
<p>Prior to actual operation, a review of the operation requirements and check of valid experiment requests and approvals must be made. An operation request form documents the request and the valid experiment approval. All actions of this procedure require the direct supervision of a reactor operator with a valid license.</p>

<div><p>Actions for the Reactor Startup, Operating and Shutdown require certain specific conditions. Prior to startup, the correct operating conditions are verified by the performance of a Startup Checklist. Following the final Reactor Shutdown of the day, a Shutdown Checklist is performed to place all secondary and supportive systems in their post operating mode and required data is annotated. Logs will be taken in a hand written or computer form, whichever is determined by the reactor manager.</p>
<p>Guidance for startup and operation of the reactor is available in the operator’s manual. Features of the procedure provide requirements and guidance.</p>
<p>All actions of this procedure require the direct supervision of a reactor operator with a valid license. Abnormal shutdown or SCRAMS require a SRO approval prior to restart of the reactor.</p>

<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>Sequences for the pulse mode operation use TR positions that create a positive reactivity insertion as the rod moves from a set position X to 100% WITHDRAWN.
The motion of the control rod will thus cover the full range from 0% to 100%. At the time of actuation of the fire button, the core will be sub-critical by at least one dollar.
Performance following this insertion will be expected to produce a 100% output within 10 milliseconds.
iv.  From TR rod worth curve calculate total reactivity gain for the TR 100% withdrawal position.
v.   Subtract the pulse insertion amount from 100% rod worth. (Maximum allowable Pulse is $3.00)
vi.  Use the final rod worth and determine the initial height of TR rod on the rod worth table.  This is the pre-pulse position of the TR for the initial 50 watt critical condition.

<section id="id10">
<h3>I. Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#id10" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This procedure details the steps for operation, startup, and shutdown of the reactor water systems.</p>
<p>The reactor water system is composed of the reactor pool and two water process systems.
The pool structure contains water that moderates the neutron energy spectrum, cools the fuel in the reactor core, and provides radiation shielding. Pool water level sensors provide detection of water loss conditions.</p>
<p>Pool water purity is maintained by operation of the purification system.
A pump, pool suction, pool skimmer, pool return, piping, valves, filter, resin tank with resin, flow meter, and instrumentation comprise the purification system.
At a normal flow of 6 to 10 gallons per minute, the approximately 10,500-gallon volume of the pool flows through the system once every 18 to 29 hours.
Sensors in the purification piping monitor water conductivity.</p>
<p>Bulk pool water temperature is controlled by operation of the coolant system when the reactor is operated at power levels above 100 Kilowatt and/or for extended periods of time.
A central chilling station at the university site provides the cooling heat sink.
Water pressure control prevents water system leakage from the primary pool water to the secondary chilling water.
An alarm annunciates loss of differential pressure control at the heat exchanger.</p>
<p>Apply this procedure daily or each time the reactor is taken through an operation cycle of startup and shutdown.</p>

<h3>I. INTRODUCTION<a class="headerlink" href="#id12" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This procedure details the steps for operation, mode change, startup, shutdown, and response to abnormal conditions for the air confinement system.</p>
<p>The air confinement system is composed of the room enclosing the reactor and two air ventilation systems. The reactor room walls, weather-stripping at doorways and the ventilation ducts confine the airflow pathway through the reactor bay.</p>
<p>The main HVAC system is composed of fans, ducts, heating-cooling coils, and environmental controls for temperature and humidity of room air. The system also maintains a negative pressure in the reactor bay with respect to adjacent spaces for leakage path control. Isolation dampers are installed in all ducts entering and exiting the reactor bay. Isolation dampers close automatically if the particulate air monitor senses a high airborne radiation level. Operation of the system is in either the re-circulation mode for economy or in the intake-exhaust mode providing at least two fresh air changes per hour for reducing the buildup of radioactive gases during reactor operation.</p>
<p>The argon purge system is a separate exhaust system that can be operated to reduce the quantity of radioactivity released to the bulk air in the reactor bay. The system draws air directly from the reactor pool surface and from experimental cavities. This air is then exhausted through a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter to the exterior of the building. An Argon-41 monitor samples, displays, and records the radioactivity levels of the argon purge system exhaust.</p>
<p>Visual, audible and remote alarms indicate abnormal levels of radioactivity in either the particulate air monitor or gaseous argon-41 monitor. The particulate air monitor provides the signal, to stop ventilation fans and close isolation dampers.</p>
<p>A fume-sort hood for radioactive sample handling with HEPA filter and isolation damper can also exhaust air from the reactor bay. Configuration of the fume-sort hood is not complete for experimental use. The system has been designed and tested to meet the general requirements of the reactor bay ventilation system. Operation procedures of the fume-sort hood in SURV-5 are for test and demonstration only. Detailed operation procedures and an RWP will be developed prior to its use.</p>
<p>Apply this procedure daily or each time the reactor is taken through an operation cycle of startup and shutdown.</p>

<li><p>Verify HVAC automatic isolation feature is functional.
Use record of most recent function check during the last system surveillance.</p></li>
<li><p>Operate the HVAC system in the REACTOR ON or OFF mode.
Refer to Reactor Room HVAC procedures (Section B).
HVAC operation controls room air dilution rates and effluent radioactivity.
HVAC system operation in REACTOR OFF mode re-circulates reactor bay air,
REACTOR ON mode operation exhausts reactor bay air and supplies fresh air.</p></li>
<li><p>Operate the Argon Purge system.
Refer to Argon Purge System procedures (Section C).
Purge system exhausts Ar<sup>41</sup> effluent from reactor areas.
Ar<sup>41</sup> production occurs in air that is found in the areas of the reactor core.
Two production sources are air in the reactor water and air in experiment facilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Monitor operating confinement system’s performance.
Refer to instructions in Attachment for response to abnormal conditions.
Determine the cause of each abnormal condition.
Implement corrective or maintenance actions for conditions.
Abnormal conditions that substantially affect system performance are of two types:
a. One type affects the air confinement isolation function of the system.
b. The other type affects control of room pressure differences (&gt; 0.04 inches). Measure pressure difference between the reactor room and adjacent areas.
Report abnormal conditions to a supervisory operator.</p></li>
<li><p>Do NOT operate Fume-Sort Hood system without an experiment approval.
Operate Fume-sort hood according to experiment requirements and limitations.
Refer to appropriate Procedures for the experiment. <em>(No Procedures currently exist.)</em></p></li>
