OPER-6 Reactor Bay Systems
==========================

I. INTRODUCTION
---------------

A. Purpose
^^^^^^^^^^

Several key building systems are either necessary for reactor operation or represent a potential hazard to safe operation.  
This procedure identifies key systems and operation constraints, but should be operable at all other times.

B. Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Key systems such as the security or access control system must be operable at all times.  
Other systems such as the communication system must be operable for reactor operation,  
but should be operable at all other times.

Operability checks and Maintenance logs record the condition or modification of Key systems.  
These logs supplement the requirements of Surveillance and Maintenance Procedures.

The 5-ton lifting capacity of the bridge crane has the potential to seriously injure personnel and damage equipment.  
Proper operation and understanding of the consequences is necessary to assure safe, effective and reliable use of the crane system.

C. Schedule
^^^^^^^^^^^

Apply this procedure daily or each time the reactor is taken through an operation cycle of startup and shutdown.

II. PROCEDURE
-------------

A. Building Utilities and Safety Systems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Building utilities should be functional at all times.  
Utilities are electric power, chilled water, compressed air, and security equipment.

Safety systems shall be functional at all times unless special provisions are in effect.  
Safety systems are emergency lights, fire protection equipment, and communications.

B. Status Checks of Systems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Check for normal operational status of each system.  
In the event that key equipment does not perform properly, do the following:

1. Report conditions that are not normal.  
   a. Record unexplained CSC warning and scram messages in the ICS Acknowledge Log.  
   b. Record unexplained NM1000 stack messages in the NM1000 Stack Fault Log.

2. Tag components that are not functional.

3. Classify component as inoperable or defective.

4. Record date, problem and status on each tag.

5. Remove tag only after correction of the problem.  
   If applicable, record the corrective action in maintenance log.

C. Maintenance Log
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A maintenance log will document repairs and modifications to important systems.  
Use a separate Maintenance Log Sheet for each system.

1. Systems that require log entries include the following:  
   a. TRIGA ICS (refer to MAIN-1, 2, & 3),  
   b. Radiation Monitors (refer to MAIN-4),  
   c. Pool Water System (refer to OPER-5 & SURV-5),  
   d. Room Confinement System (refer to OPER-5 & SURV-6).

2. Maintenance of equipment shall consider the requirements of 10CFR50.59.  
   Systems in the preceding list must meet the requirements of the SAR and 50.59.

3. Record the installation of temporary jumpers in key system components in the ICS Jumper Log.

D. Reactor Operation Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Operation of the reactor and other special conditions will require:

1. Physical security system shall be continuously operable or appropriate steps taken to provide adequate protection of control access area.  
   Documentation of physical security requirements is not a requirement of this procedure.

2. Communications via telephone to off site locations shall be available and must be operable for any reactor operation.

3. The video camera system should be operable in areas where experiments and personnel are active.  
   A camera and video monitor may be necessary to supplement other controls.

4. The air confinement system and pool water systems must be operable for reactor operation.  
   Documentation of operating conditions for these systems is in OPER-1 Startup-Shutdown checks, OPER-4 Operation of Reactor Water Systems, and OPER-5 Operation of Air Confinement System.

E. Reactor Bay Bridge Crane Operation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Check date and lift capacity of last load test.  
   Load tests shall test capacity at 125% of load.  
   The load test includes test of crane, cable, hook and load rigging.  
   Identify the rigging components and the test object and weight.

   a. Load lifts less than one ton may require verification.  
      Verification requires inspection of previous load test date and capacity on UT Crane Load Test sheet.

   b. Load lifts greater than one ton should require execution of appropriate load test.  
      Load test should have been done within the previous two years or following maintenance of key crane components.

   c. Loads of less than one ton are Light Loads.  
      Light loads should not be lifted more than 5 feet above the floor.  
      Lift should not exceed five-foot limit except at lift terminal points.

   d. Loads greater than one ton are Heavy Loads.  
      Heavy loads shall not be lifted more than 5 feet above the floor.  
      Lift may not exceed five-foot limit except at lift terminal points.

   e. No load suspended more than 5 feet above the floor shall be unattended.

2. Any person operating the crane shall require training.  
   Training is to be equivalent to the information in the Instruction Manual.

   a. Crane key is to be available only during periods in which the crane is in use.  
      Operability of the crane control pushbuttons shall be by key lock.  
      A cutoff control box can shut off all power to the bridge crane system.

   b. Approval shall be required for load lifts over the reactor shield structure.  
      The reactor supervisor will review and approve all load lifts in reactor bay.

   c. No load lifts above the reactor shall be made during operation of the reactor.  
      This includes all areas above the reactor shield structure.

   d. No personnel shall perform activities directly beneath a suspended load.

   e. No loads should be left suspended directly above other facility equipment.

   f. Storage location of crane should be:  
      - Direction of bridge: South  
      - Direction of trolley: West  
      - Level of hook: Full Up

3. Review caution information at crane controls.  
   **DO NOT LIFT A LOAD GREATER THAN 5 TONS** except for load test.

4. Review functional operation of crane controls.

5. Switch control pendant key to ON position.  
   Check power to crane bridge if control pendant switches do not operate.

6. Move bridge, trolley, and hook to lifting position.

7. Load rigging shall be checked for alignment and binding as lift tension is applied.

8. Motion of load should be controlled to avoid collisions.  
   Potential collision objects are other facility structures or equipment.

9. After load is disconnected, move bridge, trolley, and hook to storage position.

10. Switch control pendant key to OFF position.  
    Secure control pendant key.
