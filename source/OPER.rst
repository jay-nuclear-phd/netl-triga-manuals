OPER-1 Startup-Shutdown Checks
==============================

I. Introduction
---------------

A. Purpose
~~~~~~~~~~

   This procedure describe the facility and reactor system checks to be done prior to startup of the reactor and subsequent to shutdown of the reactor including a check of operation requests for valid experiments.

B. Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Opeation of the reactor requires test and verification of Instrumentation Control and Safety (ICS) System functions and other facility systems.
   Checklists for the test and verification of ICS System and checks of support systems assure that systems are operable prior to or during operation of the reactor.

   Several facility systems must function properly for the reactor systems to operate safely. The two most important are the pool water system and air confinement system. Other equipment such as communication equipment and radiation monitoring equipment are also necessary for operation. A checklist documents the status of various systems. Both pre-start checks and post shutdown checks are for the purpose of verifying the operability or condition of important systems.

   Prior to actual operation, a review of the operation requirements and check of valid experiment requests and approvals must be made. An operation request form documents the request and the valid experiment approval. All actions of this procedure require the direct supervision of a reactor operator with a valid license.

C. Schedule
~~~~~~~~~~~

   Apply this procedure each day the reactor is taken through an operation cycle of startup and shutdown.

OPER-2 Reactor Startup, Operating and Shutdown
==============================================

I. Introduction
---------------

A. Purpose
~~~~~~~~~~

   The Reactor Startup, Operating and Shutdown procedure specifies actions to be completed for startup, operating and shutdown of the reactor. This new procedure is a combination of the old OPER 2 (Reactor Startup and Shutdown) and OPER 3 (Reactor Operations Mode).

B. Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Actions for the Reactor Startup, Operating and Shutdown require certain specific conditions. Prior to startup, the correct operating conditions are verified by the performance of a Startup Checklist. Following the final Reactor Shutdown of the day, a Shutdown Checklist is performed to place all secondary and supportive systems in their post operating mode and required data is annotated. Logs will be taken in a hand written or computer form, whichever is determined by the reactor manager.

   Guidance for startup and operation of the reactor is available in the operator's manual. Features of the procedure provide requirements and guidance.

   All actions of this procedure require the direct supervision of a reactor operator with a valid license. Abnormal shutdown or SCRAMS require a SRO approval prior to restart of the reactor.

C. Schedule
~~~~~~~~~~~

   Apply this procedure each day the reactor is taken through an operation cycle of a startup, operating mode and shutdown.

II. Procedure
-------------

.. _OPER-2.II.A:

A. Reactor Startup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The Reactor startup can be performed in various modes. Ensure that you review the correct mode for the startup you will be performing. Ensure all corresponding requirements have been completed and that a current Startup Checklist has been performed.

   1. Review operation procedure for the mode of operations you will be conducting.  
      The Console Log, whether paper or electronic, will record operator comments regarding important system conditions.  
      These log sheets will supplement computer printouts from the ICS system.  
      Other data sheets such as the Operation Request, Startup-Shutdown Checklist and Reactivity Calculation Sheet complete normal documentation for a typical run.

   2. Review completion of the Startup Checklist and note the recorded conditions.  
      If this is a startup after the initial startup of the day, verify the startup checklist was completed and monitor system indications to ensure that no lineups have been altered since the reactor was last operating.  
      Review any Night Order Log comments that are new since the last time you operated the reactor.  
      If a problem occurs at the time of reactor startup or shutdown, place a comment in the Console Log and ensure the Senior Reactor Operator is informed.  
      Additionally, record any abnormal indications.  
      If questions exist regarding acceptability of operating conditions, consult the Senior Reactor Operator on watch or the Reactor Manager.

   3. Verify the control room door is closed and the required licensed operators are signed in to log with line stating the relieved and relieving operators in the comment section.  
      If this is not the initial startup, ensure SRO permission to conduct startup of reactor and obtain required power.  
      The minimum staffing requirements are:  

      a) Normal operations: SRO/RO, with second person in building (SRO must be available).  
         Second person signature required in logs after 1730.  
      b) Initial Startup: Requirements of II.3.a. and SRO present (SRO may be the second person in the building).

   .. note::
      *If startup is following a SCRAM, condition of SCRAM must be identified, and SRO approval to startup obtained.  
      SRO must sign and date SCRAM log entry.*  
      *(If verbal approval over phone for startup after SCRAM is given, it must be noted in logs and SCRAM log entry signed as soon as SRO returns to facility).*

   4. Perform operator log on function.

   5. Determine desired mode of operation. Review Typical Startup and Operating Sequences (Section II.B.).

   .. note::
      *A log (capture of Status Window) should be taken by pressing F2 after each power change and approximately every 30 minutes during steady state operation.  
      Verification that the reactor area radiation monitoring system is operating correctly should be performed at this time and annotated in the Console Log.*

   6. When operations are complete, perform shutdown procedures. (Refer to Section II.C.)

.. _OPER-2.II.B:

B. Typical Startup and Operating Sequences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The Manual and Auto Modes start with the Manual Mode procedure.  
   When the required power is obtained, the Mode is shifted to Auto.  
   Rod positions increment from 0 to 960 (equal to a span of 15 inches).  
   The initial startup requires an excess Reactivity Configuration at 50 watts.

   1. Manual Mode: (Refer to Chapter 4 of Control Console Operator's Manual)  
      
      a) Withdraw transient rod to approximately 50% withdrawn position or position of previous startup of the day or previous startup of similar experiments and burn up.
      b) Withdraw Regulating rod to similar position as transient rod.  
      c) Withdraw each shim rod in steps of 50 units or less alternating shim rods.  
      d) Monitor period and maintain as close to 20 seconds as possible while not going less than 10 seconds.  
      e) Adjust each rod to maintain period as in 1.d., attempt to maintain bank with rods.  
      f) Take a pause at 50W to verify rod heights are similar to those of latest Reactivity Configuration calculation and days history of operation.  
      g) Adjust rods to stabilize power level at desired level.

   2. Auto Mode: (Refer to Chapter 5 of Control Console Operator's Manual)

      a) Set power demand to desired power.  
      b) Follow procedure for Manual Mode.  
      c) Press Auto Mode Switch when desired power is reached.  
      d) Adjust rod heights to a bank position for best operation.

   3. Square Wave Mode: (Refer to Chapter 5 of Control Console Operator's Manual)

      *Note: Testing has proven that maximum Square wave should be limited to 500kW.*

      a) Sequences for square wave mode operation use transient rod (TR) positions that create a positive reactivity insertion as the rod moves from 0 to set position associated with the amount of reactivity desired to achieve desired power.  
      At the time of actuation of the fire button, the core will be set at a steady state power less than 1 kW (testing has proven the best results occur with initial power set at 800 Watts).

         i.   Choose desired amount of reactivity to add from the movement of TR. (Amount added cannot be greater than 1 dollar (< $1.00). ($0.90 has proven during testing to be the best amount to add for square waves greater than 200kW)  
         ii.  From TR rod worth data determine the rod position associated with the desired reactivity addition.  
         iii. Compare estimated values with previous results if possible.

      b) Obtain steady state (SS) power on REG, shim 1 and shim 2, 800 watts is typical (<1kW):
         
         i.   Withdraw REG rod to approximately 50% withdrawn position.
         ii.  Withdraw each shim rod in steps of 50 units or less.
         iii. Monitor period and maintain as close to 20 seconds as possible while not going less than 10 seconds.
         iv.  Do not exceed 10-second period.
         v.   Stabilize power by moving shim rods into a banked position while leaving REG rod at approximately 50% withdrawn position.
            (This will prevent REG rod from reaching its fully withdrawn position during square wave transient operations.)

      c) Initiate Square Wave:

         i.   Verify transient rod is at 0% position.
         ii.  Check rod at low limit, turn air pressure off.
         iii. Withdraw drive cylinder to position determined in 3.a.ii above.
         iv.  Check power <1kW. Place in manual mode.
         v.   Set Demand Power thumbwheels to desired SS power.
         vi.  Press Square Wave Switch. Verify SQUARE WAVE light illuminates and console system mode is SQUARE WAVE READY.
         vii. Press Fire switch. (System will switch to AUTO mode if demand power is reached in 10 seconds. 
            System will switch to MANUAL mode if demand power is NOT reached in 10 seconds.)
         viii. Adjust transient rod height as necessary to limit REG rod withdraw due to temperature coefficient effects.
         ix.  When power has stabilized, bank rods for BEST performance.
         x.   Take log (F2).

   4. Pulse Mode: (Refer to Chapter 6 of Control Console Operator's Manual)

      a) Sequences for the pulse mode operation use TR positions that create a positive reactivity insertion as the rod moves from a set position X to 100% WITHDRAWN.
         The motion of the control rod will thus cover the full range from 0% to 100%. At the time of actuation of the fire button, the core will be sub-critical by at least one dollar.
         Performance following this insertion will be expected to produce a 100% output within 10 milliseconds.
         iv.  From TR rod worth curve calculate total reactivity gain for the TR 100% withdrawal position.
         v.   Subtract the pulse insertion amount from 100% rod worth. (Maximum allowable Pulse is $3.00)
         vi.  Use the final rod worth and determine the initial height of TR rod on the rod worth table.  This is the pre-pulse position of the TR for the initial 50 watt critical condition.
         vii. Verify SURV 7 annual comparison pulse is current.

      .. note::

         Example: You want to perform a $2.00 pulse. Total rod worth for the TR is 358.077,  
         358.077 (Trw) - 2.00 (Prw) = 158.077 (Initial rw TR).  
         Using the rod worth curve this value is equal to a TR height of 410 units.  
         For the 50W power level, we would then place TR at 410 and bring the remaining rods to the bank height required to obtain 50W.

      b) Obtain steady state power, 50W is typical. (< 1kW):

         i.   Withdraw Transient rod to the position calculated in step 4.a.iii above.
         ii.  Withdraw REG rod to approximately 50% withdrawn position.
         iii. Withdraw shim 1 and shim 2 in alternating 50 units or less increments.
         iv.  Monitor period and maintain as close to 20 seconds as possible while not going less than 10 seconds.
         v.   Adjust REG, shim 1 and shim 2 rods alternately to maintain period.
         vi.  Stabilize power and bank REG, shim 1 and shim 2 rods.

      c) Initiate Pulse Mode:

         i.   Insert TR to 0% position.
         ii.  Check TR at low limit, turn air pressure off by pressing yellow air light.
         iii. Withdraw TR drive cylinder to 100% position (960).
         iv.  Check power < 1 kW, dpm < +1.
         v.   Press Pulse Mode switch. Verify pulse light illuminates.
         vi.  Enter record information for pulse data.
         vii. Verify mode is pulse ready.
         viii. Press Fire switch.
         ix.  System will switch to SCRAM mode at conclusion of pulse to display the pulse data.
         x.   Refer to B.1 to return to manual operation. Verify pulse bypass functions are reset to non-pulse conditions:

            a. Perform SCRAM test on console for Percent 1 and Percent 2 to test reset of bypass relay and reset of gain relay.  
               Observe decay of pulse power to ensure NM1000 power signal output is functioning.

   1. Normal shutdown:

      a) There are three options:

         1. Switch to Manual Mode and insert each rod individually.  
         2. Switch to Manual Mode and insert all rods simultaneously.  
         3. Manual SCRAM reactor.

      b) Ensure all rod drives and control rods are in the down position.

OPER-4 Operation of Reactor Water Systems
=========================================

I. Introduction
---------------

A. Purpose
~~~~~~~~~~

   This procedure details the steps for operation, startup, and shutdown of the reactor water systems.

B. Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The reactor water system is composed of the reactor pool and two water process systems.
   The pool structure contains water that moderates the neutron energy spectrum, cools the fuel in the reactor core, and provides radiation shielding. Pool water level sensors provide detection of water loss conditions.

   Pool water purity is maintained by operation of the purification system.  
   A pump, pool suction, pool skimmer, pool return, piping, valves, filter, resin tank with resin, flow meter, and instrumentation comprise the purification system.  
   At a normal flow of 6 to 10 gallons per minute, the approximately 10,500-gallon volume of the pool flows through the system once every 18 to 29 hours.  
   Sensors in the purification piping monitor water conductivity.

   Bulk pool water temperature is controlled by operation of the coolant system when the reactor is operated at power levels above 100 Kilowatt and/or for extended periods of time.  
   A central chilling station at the university site provides the cooling heat sink.  
   Water pressure control prevents water system leakage from the primary pool water to the secondary chilling water.  
   An alarm annunciates loss of differential pressure control at the heat exchanger.

C. Schedule
~~~~~~~~~~~

   Apply this procedure daily or each time the reactor is taken through an operation cycle of startup and shutdown.

II. PROCEDURE
-------------

.. _OPER-4.II.A:

A. General Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   1. Check pool water level each time the water system status changes.
      Status changes are startup or shutdown of the purification or coolant system.
      Normal pool water level is 8.10 ± 0.05 meters.
      (Measure pool level relative to the bottom of the reactor tank.)

   2. Monitor pool level by continual or intermittent (daily) observation.

      a. A pool level monitor provides monitoring of hi or lo conditions.
      Alarm levels are hi (+5 cm) and lo (-5 cm) relative to the 8.10-meter level.

      b. Siphon breaks are present on the purification and coolant system pipes.
      Siphon break levels are at pool levels of 7.6 meters or above.

      c. Make visual observations of pool level at least twice each day:

         i.   If the pool level monitor is not functioning and;
         ii.  A system without siphon breaks can cause a siphon action, or
         iii. A system without siphon breaks extends below the siphon break level.

   3. Replace pool water evaporation losses with makeup supply de-ionized water.
      Follow makeup water instructions in surveillance procedures (refer to SURV-4).
      Review makeup water volume each month.
      Abnormal water loss may be an indication of a leak.

   4. Operate the pool purification system per instructions in Section B.
      Purification system should maintain pool conductivity less than 2 µmho/cm.
      Pool conductivity limit is 5 µmho/cm (monthly average).

      a. The purification system should be operated continuously but it is not a requirement for reactor operation.

      b. If purification system is operating:
      A reactor operator presence in the facility is *not* a requirement.

   5. Operate the pool coolant system per instructions in Section C.
      Coolant system should maintain pool temperature less than 38°C (100°F).
      Pool temperature maximum limit is 48°C (118°F). No minimum limit has been set.

      a. Coolant system operation is not a requirement for reactor operation.
      It should be operated at reactor power levels above 100 kW except for power calibrations.

      b. If the coolant system is operating:
      A reactor operator should be present at the facility.
      A reactor operator should periodically check system conditions.

   6. Monitor performance of pool purification and coolant water systems.

      a. Refer to instructions in Attachment for response to abnormal conditions.

      b. Determine the cause for abnormal condition.
      Implement corrective actions if conditions affect system performance, or
      Implement maintenance actions if conditions affect system performance.

      c. Report abnormal conditions to a supervisory reactor operator (SRO).

.. _OPER-4.II.B:

B. Pool Purification System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Operation:

   a. Operate the purification system to maintain pool water purity.
   Operate system continuously except for maintenance or special conditions.
   Pool water pH should be neutral (5 < pH < 9).
   Conductivity should be < 2 µmho/cm (> 0.5 megohm-cm).
   Conductivity limit for any condition is 5 µmho/cm (0.2 megohm-cm).

   b. Operate pool water surface skimmer to control floating particulate deposits.
   Pool subsurface intake may bypass the skimmer for special applications.
   Operation of the pool skimmer as a normal operating condition is preferable.

   c. Review purification system function each day the reactor operates.
   Observe water flow rate, conductivity, and pressure.

2. Startup:

   a. Verify valve alignment at purification skid:
   Pool supply valve is OPEN,
   Pool return valve is OPEN,
   Both resin sluice valves are CLOSED.

OPER-5 Air Confinement System Operation
=======================================

I. INTRODUCTION
---------------

A. Purpose
^^^^^^^^^^

This procedure details the steps for operation, mode change, startup, shutdown, and response to abnormal conditions for the air confinement system.

B. Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The air confinement system is composed of the room enclosing the reactor and two air ventilation systems. The reactor room walls, weather-stripping at doorways and the ventilation ducts confine the airflow pathway through the reactor bay.

The main HVAC system is composed of fans, ducts, heating-cooling coils, and environmental controls for temperature and humidity of room air. The system also maintains a negative pressure in the reactor bay with respect to adjacent spaces for leakage path control. Isolation dampers are installed in all ducts entering and exiting the reactor bay. Isolation dampers close automatically if the particulate air monitor senses a high airborne radiation level. Operation of the system is in either the re-circulation mode for economy or in the intake-exhaust mode providing at least two fresh air changes per hour for reducing the buildup of radioactive gases during reactor operation.

The argon purge system is a separate exhaust system that can be operated to reduce the quantity of radioactivity released to the bulk air in the reactor bay. The system draws air directly from the reactor pool surface and from experimental cavities. This air is then exhausted through a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter to the exterior of the building. An Argon-41 monitor samples, displays, and records the radioactivity levels of the argon purge system exhaust.

Visual, audible and remote alarms indicate abnormal levels of radioactivity in either the particulate air monitor or gaseous argon-41 monitor. The particulate air monitor provides the signal, to stop ventilation fans and close isolation dampers.

A fume-sort hood for radioactive sample handling with HEPA filter and isolation damper can also exhaust air from the reactor bay. Configuration of the fume-sort hood is not complete for experimental use. The system has been designed and tested to meet the general requirements of the reactor bay ventilation system. Operation procedures of the fume-sort hood in SURV-5 are for test and demonstration only. Detailed operation procedures and an RWP will be developed prior to its use.

C. Schedule

4. Fume-Sort Hood Procedure (Future Use)

II. PROCEDURE
-------------

A. General Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Verify reactor room confinement CAMs are operating.  
   The CAMs are the particulate monitor and Ar\ :sup:`41` gaseous activity monitor.

2. Verify HVAC automatic isolation feature is functional.  
   Use record of most recent function check during the last system surveillance.

3. Operate the HVAC system in the REACTOR ON or OFF mode.  
   Refer to Reactor Room HVAC procedures (Section B).  
   HVAC operation controls room air dilution rates and effluent radioactivity.  
   HVAC system operation in REACTOR OFF mode re-circulates reactor bay air,  
   REACTOR ON mode operation exhausts reactor bay air and supplies fresh air.

4. Operate the Argon Purge system.  
   Refer to Argon Purge System procedures (Section C).  
   Purge system exhausts Ar\ :sup:`41` effluent from reactor areas.  
   Ar\ :sup:`41` production occurs in air that is found in the areas of the reactor core.  
   Two production sources are air in the reactor water and air in experiment facilities.

5. Monitor operating confinement system’s performance.  
   Refer to instructions in Attachment for response to abnormal conditions.  
   Determine the cause of each abnormal condition.  
   Implement corrective or maintenance actions for conditions.  
   Abnormal conditions that substantially affect system performance are of two types:  
   a. One type affects the air confinement isolation function of the system.  
   b. The other type affects control of room pressure differences (> 0.04 inches). Measure pressure difference between the reactor room and adjacent areas.  
   Report abnormal conditions to a supervisory operator.

6. Do NOT operate Fume-Sort Hood system without an experiment approval.  
   Operate Fume-sort hood according to experiment requirements and limitations.  
   Refer to appropriate Procedures for the experiment. *(No Procedures currently exist.)*

B. Reactor Room HVAC System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Operation

   a. Verify HVAC system is operable, refer to last monthly surveillance per SURV-5.

      ii. Automatic trip of HVAC duct isolation dampers shall be operable or corrective action being taken  
      iii. Automatic trip of HVAC fans shall be operable or corrective action being taken  
      Particulate air monitor provides automatic trip signal (set point 10,000 cpm).  
      Isolation may also be initiated by manual shutdown.

   b. Determine HVAC system mode required:  
      Normal HVAC system mode is REACTOR ON if reactor is operating.  
      HVAC system shall be in the REACTOR ON mode if the Argon purge system is OFF and the reactor is operating.  
      The HVAC system may operate in the REACTOR OFF mode during reactor operation only if the argon purge system is operating, or corrective action is being taken.

   c. Operate HVAC system for confinement of room air.  
      Control HVAC system operation from the Control Room Panel (CRP).

A. Purpose
~~~~~~~~~~

   Several key building systems are either necessary for reactor operation or represent a potential hazard to safe operation.  
   This procedure identifies key systems and operation constraints, but should be operable at all other times.

B. Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Key systems such as the security or access control system must be operable at all times.  
   Other systems such as the communication system must be operable for reactor operation,

II. PROCEDURE
-------------

A. Building Utilities and Safety Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Building utilities should be functional at all times.  
Utilities are electric power, chilled water, compressed air, and security equipment.

Safety systems shall be functional at all times unless special provisions are in effect.  
Safety systems are emergency lights, fire protection equipment, and communications.

B. Status Checks of Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check for normal operational status of each system.  
In the event that key equipment does not perform properly, do the following:

1. Report conditions that are not normal.  
   a. Record unexplained CSC warning and scram messages in the ICS Acknowledge Log.  
   b. Record unexplained NM1000 stack messages in the NM1000 Stack Fault Log.

2. Tag components that are not functional.

3. Classify component as inoperable or defective.

4. Record date, problem and status on each tag.

5. Remove tag only after correction of the problem.  
   If applicable, record the corrective action in maintenance log.

C. Maintenance Log
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A maintenance log will document repairs and modifications to important systems.  
Use a separate Maintenance Log Sheet for each system.

1. Systems that require log entries include the following:  
   a. TRIGA ICS (refer to MAIN-1, 2, & 3),  
   b. Radiation Monitors (refer to MAIN-4),  
   c. Pool Water System (refer to OPER-5 & SURV-5),  
   d. Room Confinement System (refer to OPER-5 & SURV-6).

2. Maintenance of equipment shall consider the requirements of 10CFR50.59.  
   Systems in the preceding list must meet the requirements of the SAR and 50.59.

3. Record the installation of temporary jumpers in key system components in the ICS Jumper Log.

D. Reactor Operation Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Operation of the reactor and other special conditions will require:

1. Physical security system shall be continuously operable or appropriate steps taken to provide adequate protection of control access area.  
   Documentation of physical security requirements is not a requirement of this procedure.

2. Communications via telephone to off site locations shall be available and must be operable for any reactor operation.

3. The video camera system should be operable in areas where experiments and personnel are active.  
   A camera and video monitor may be necessary to supplement other controls.

4. The air confinement system and pool water systems must be operable for reactor operation.  
   Documentation of operating conditions for these systems is in OPER-1 Startup-Shutdown checks, OPER-4 Operation of Reactor Water Systems, and OPER-5 Operation of Air Confinement System.

E. Reactor Bay Bridge Crane Operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Check date and lift capacity of last load test.  
   Load tests shall test capacity at 125% of load.  
   The load test includes test of crane, cable, hook and load rigging.  
   Identify the rigging components and the test object and weight.

   a. Load lifts less than one ton may require verification.  
      Verification requires inspection of previous load test date and capacity on UT Crane Load Test sheet.

   b. Load lifts greater than one ton should require execution of appropriate load test.  
      Load test should have been done within the previous two years or following maintenance of key crane components.

   c. Loads of less than one ton are Light Loads.  
      Light loads should not be lifted more than 5 feet above the floor.  
      Lift should not exceed five-foot limit except at lift terminal points.

   d. Loads greater than one ton are Heavy Loads.  
      Heavy loads shall not be lifted more than 5 feet above the floor.  
      Lift may not exceed five-foot limit except at lift terminal points.

   e. No load suspended more than 5 feet above the floor shall be unattended.

2. Any person operating the crane shall require training.  
   Training is to be equivalent to the information in the Instruction Manual.

   a. Crane key is to be available only during periods in which the crane is in use.  
      Operability of the crane control pushbuttons shall be by key lock.  
      A cutoff control box can shut off all power to the bridge crane system.

   b. Approval shall be required for load lifts over the reactor shield structure.  
      The reactor supervisor will review and approve all load lifts in reactor bay.

   c. No load lifts above the reactor shall be made during operation of the reactor.  
      This includes all areas above the reactor shield structure.

   d. No personnel shall perform activities directly beneath a suspended load.

   e. No loads should be left suspended directly above other facility equipment.

   f. Storage location of crane should be:  
      - Direction of bridge: South  
      - Direction of trolley: West  
      - Level of hook: Full Up

3. Review caution information at crane controls.  
   **DO NOT LIFT A LOAD GREATER THAN 5 TONS** except for load test.

4. Review functional operation of crane controls.

5. Switch control pendant key to ON position.  
   Check power to crane bridge if control pendant switches do not operate.

6. Move bridge, trolley, and hook to lifting position.

7. Load rigging shall be checked for alignment and binding as lift tension is applied.

8. Motion of load should be controlled to avoid collisions.  
   Potential collision objects are other facility structures or equipment.

9. After load is disconnected, move bridge, trolley, and hook to storage position.

10. Switch control pendant key to OFF position.  
    Secure control pendant key.
