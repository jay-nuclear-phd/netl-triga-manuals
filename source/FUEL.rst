FUEL-1 Movement of Fuel
=======================

I. INTRODUCTION
---------------

A. PURPOSE
~~~~~~~~~~
   The instructions of this procedure are to control the movement
   of reactor fuel components within the reactor core grid
   structure and to or from storage locations.

B. DESCRIPTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Reactivity changes occur as fuel is added to the reactor core or
   storage locations. To assure adequate safety margins for the
   proper performance of the control rod system, procedural
   controls define the requirements and limitations for fuel
   movement within the reactor core and storage areas. These rules
   include changing the arrangement of fuel components as well as
   fuel additions or deletions.

C. Schedule
~~~~~~~~~~~

   Apply this procedure each time fuel is moved.

A. TRIGA Fuel Movement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   1.0 See following P&I Procedure Change Insert Page

   1.1 A senior reactor operator shall supervise all movements of fuel, including movements to or from the reactor core grid structure and movements between storage locations. At least one person should assist with the handling of the fuel elements.

   2. Restrict all fuel element arrays except the reactor core to
      an array limit of less than 20 elements.

      a. Store fuel elements in the fuel storage wells or
         in the reactor pool. Use the 19 element
         hexagonal array racks (these may be stacked two
         deep per well) or the 6 or staggered 12 element
         linear array racks.

      b. Elements not in storage racks or shipment casks
         should be in groups of three or less.

   3. Plan fuel movement activities so as to minimize the number
      of individual moves required to achieve the desired result.

   4. Move elements between the reactor core, storage racks,
      shipment casks or other locations with special fuel
      handling tool.

   5. Maintain access control or restrict use of fuel handling
      tool by lock if fuel movements are not in progress.

   6. Test fuel handling tool on non-fuel element prior to use.

   7. Approve by inspection and test any device other than the
      fuel handling tool prior to use for movement of fuel.
      Handle the instrument elements with the extension tubes.
      Handle control followers with the extension rods.

   8. Handle fuel elements carefully. Care should be taken not
      to bump or scrape elements. Minimize the possibility and
      potential consequences of an accidental drop of an element.

   9. The Pool Area radiation monitor shall be functional during
      fuel movement in or to and from the reactor pool.

  10. Verify a gamma sensitive survey instrument (with audible or
      alarm functions) is present in the area where the fuel
      movement will occur. A Radiation Work Permit (RWP) is
      necessary for movement of irradiated fuel beyond the
      immediate vicinity of the reactor pool access area.

  11. The air particulate monitor or substitute monitor should be
      functioning.

  12. Record all fuel element movements in the Fuel Element Log.

  13. Acknowledge by verbal response each change of fuel handling
      tool opened or closed status if two persons operate the
      tool.

  14. Acknowledge by verbal response the exchange or transfer of
      the fuel handling tool to another person.

  15. Operate and monitor the reactor console during the movement
      of fuel to or from the reactor core.

      a. Prevent movement of any control rod drive by removing
         the neutron source from the core.

      b. Place the console in Manual Mode. Verify no control
         rods will withdraw.

      c. A log of any event will be automatically recorded to
         the control system history file.

      d. Removal of a fuel followed control rod from the core
         for inspection requires a minimum shutdown margin
         greater than 0.2% Î”k/k (2 rods out) (i.e., with the rod
         being removed out and the remaining highest worth rod
         up).

      e. Movement of an instrument element requires disconnect
         and reconnect of instrument connections with a
         functional test prior to reactor operation.

  16. Verify excess reactivity and shutdown margin if fuel
      movement is to or from the reactor core. Check by
      measurement or calculate by conservative estimate.

  17. Compare control rod critical positions before and after
      movement and recalibrate if a change occurs due to movement
      of the fuel in the core.

  18. Upon completion of fuel movement the fuel handling tool
      shall be surveyed for contamination, bagged, and locked
      securely for storage in its designated location.

B. Criticality and Inventory Control of Materials in Storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   1. Storage and handling of large quantities of special nuclear
      materials (SNM), such as reactor fuel, carries the risk of
      accidental criticality if the materials are placed into a
      critical geometry or moderated with hydrogenous materials.
      Tracking of licensed SNM is required (10CFR74) and annually
      reported to the NRC via the Nuclear Materials Management and
      Safeguards System (NMMSS). The total quantity of SNM at the
      NETL shall not exceed a Category III (Low Strategic
      Significance) quantity of material as defined in 10CFR73.2
      (<10kg unirradiated). The NETL Reactor Facility License, R-
      129, requires all fuel elements to be stored in a
      geometrical array where the effective multiplication is less
      than 0.8 for all conditions of moderation. TRIGA elements
      stored in a 19 element rack and MCZPR elements stored in a
      linear array are sufficiently subcritical.

   2. SNM, other than irradiated fuel and the subcritical
      assembly, in quantities greater than 1.0 gram should be
      stored in room 2.204B, the Auxiliary Equipment Room (AER),
      when not actually in use or prepared for shipment. The
      subcritical assembly should not be stored near other fuel
      in the AER, but should be stored in its 55 gal drum
      maintained within the confines of the reactor bay. Sealed
      neutron sources (e.g., PuBe) shall NEVER be stored within
      the AER. Neutron sources may be used within the AER for
      Criticality Alarm instrument checks as noted below.

   3. A Criticality Accident alarm system is required by
      10CFR70.24 for SNM not stored underwater when the total
      quantity of enriched U-235 exceeds 700 grams. Monitoring is
      not required for fuel stored in the storage pits if they
      are maintained underwater. The NETL Criticality Accident
      monitor is a Ludlum 375 gamma and neutron unit or
      equivalent meeting the requirements of 10CFR70.24. The
      digital monitor should be mounted outside the AER with the
      detectors located adjacent to the MCZPR fuel storage
      location. The detector system is calibrated annually and
      response checked quarterly using a neutron/gamma source.
      The audible alarm setpoint should be set between 5 and 20
      mR/hr.

   4. Routine entry into the AER requires the SRO issue the key.
      The SRO will verify the individual has been trained to
      properly enter and work within the AER prior to key issue.

   5. Individuals entering the AER must note the readings of the
      Criticality Accident Monitor outside the AER and verify the
      digital meters are at typical background levels (expected
      to be less than 5.0 mR/hr and 5.0 mrem/hr) prior to entry.
      If necessary, movement of moderator (e.g., graphite,
      polyethylene, water) materials into or within the AER
      requires SRO supervision.

   6. Fuel element (TRIGA or MCZPR) movement within the NETL
      requires SRO supervision. The SRO will ensure fuel
      elements are moved in limited quantities and maintained in
      a subcritical configuration during movement.

FUEL-2 Movement of Experiments
==============================

I. PURPOSE
----------

   The purpose of this procedure is to control experiment facility or
   experiment movements that may cause reactivity changes to the reactor core.

II. DESCRIPTION
---------------

   Setup or removal of reactor core experiment facilities and experiments
   can cause substantial changes in the core configuration reactivity.
   Knowledge of these reactivity changes, both magnitude and sign, and the
   measurement of these changes is necessary to approve any configuration for
   safe operation.

IV. MATERIALS
-------------

   Radiation Work Permits (RWP) - for work within the reactor pool access
   area, or for special experiments.

V. PROCEDURE
------------

   1. A licensed operator shall supervise all experiment
      facility or experiment movements in the reactor pool.

   2. A careful examination of the reactivity
      consequences of any experiment or facility
      movement shall be reviewed.

   3. Reactivity effects greater than $1.00 shall
      require supervision by a licensed senior operator;
      reactor startup checklist shall be performed and
      k-excess adjustments made as necessary.

   4. Removal or replacement of experiment or facilities
      into or from the reactor core shall be recorded in
      the reactor logbook; a k-excess measurement shall
      be made at time of subsequent reactor criticality.

   5. All experiments in the reactor tank shall be
      secured as required by reactivity constraints.
      Experiments or objects in the reactor pool that
      represent no reactivity effect shall be secured as
      necessary to prevent potential interference with
      reactor operation.

   6. A beta-gamma survey shall be made of all objects
      or experiments removed from the pool; radiation
      tags and wipe tests should be used as necessary.

      a. Check the requirements of any extended or fixed RWP
         for work in the immediate area of the reactor pool
         access area.

      b. Special RWPâ€™s may apply to specific experiments.
