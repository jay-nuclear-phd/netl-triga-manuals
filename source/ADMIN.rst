ADMIN-1 NETL Procedure Control
==============================

1.0 PURPOSE
-----------

   - This procedure provides a standard format and establishes administrative control for the preparation, review, modification, and approval of required NETL procedures.

1.1 Discussion
--------------

   1. The NETL facility license R-129 Technical Specifications (TS ref. 1) require that written operating procedures be prepared, reviewed, and approved by the Director or a Supervisory Senior Reactor Operator (SSRO) and the Reactor Oversight Committee (ROC) for the safe operation, maintenance, surveillance, and administrative control of the NETL reactor and facility. The Emergency Response Plan and Physical Security Plan also require implementing procedures approved in the same manner, but their format may not match that of this procedure, which is written primarily for administrative and technical procedures.

   2. Consistent and clearly written procedures enable safe facility operation. It is not necessary to have the procedure document open when performing a familiar or simple task, but infrequent or complicated procedures should be reviewed prior to performing tasks.

   3. Procedures cannot be developed to cover all circumstances, therefore NETL personnel are expected to use good judgment when performing their duties.

2.0 SCOPE
---------

2.1 General
~~~~~~~~~~~

   1. This procedure supports section 6.3 of the Technical Specifications.

   2. All NETL personnel are responsible to use and follow appropriate approved procedures.

   3. Any member of NETL may draft a new procedure or prepare a revision to an existing approved procedure (see 5.4.4).

   4. The format outlined in this procedure may not apply to all PLAN (see 5.1 Procedure Designation 1.g) procedures, which may be emergency or abnormal operating procedures (see 7.0 Definitions).

   5. The Scope section shall include external requirements met by performing the procedure (e.g. regulations, NRC commitments, or Technical Specifications).

2.2 Schedule
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   1. Apply this procedure to prepare or revise an approved NETL procedure.

   2. Procedures written under a previous revision of ADMN-1 shall remain valid and will require update to this format only when they require a change other than following this (rev.4) format.

3.0 PRECAUTIONS AND LIMITATIONS
-------------------------------

   1. Though precautions and limitations are typically not applicable to administrative procedures, the overall safety of NETL workers and the NETL reactor facility shall be considered when preparing new procedures or revising old ones.

   2. If there is a problem or error with an approved procedure, the procedure shall be examined fully and, if required, a corrective action plan implemented as soon as practical consistent with the principles of a Safety Conscious Work Environment (ref. 2).

   3. Procedure notes, cautions, and warnings (see ref. 3 sec. 4.15) shall be formatted and inserted where applicable with a border increasing in line density as in the below examples (see 7.0 Definitions).

   .. note::
      Notes provide important supplemental information to users. This information is explanatory and contains no action or command.

   .. caution::
      Cautions alert users to conditions, practices, or procedures that must be observed to avoid potential hazards involving products, equipment, and conditions adversely affecting site operations.

   .. warning::
      1. Warnings alert users to conditions, practices, or procedures that must be observed to avoid loss of life or severe injury.

      2. Warnings alert users to potential hazards to personnel.

4.0 PREREQUISITES
-----------------

   1. Though Prerequisites are typically not applicable to administrative procedures, activities to be completed and requirements that shall be met prior to procedure performance shall be listed here.

      a. pre-job brief requirement for complex or infrequently performed procedures

      d. restarting the minor modification counter (e.g. Rev. 2.01 to 3.00)  
      e. starting the revision number for new procedures at revision zero (e.g. Rev. 0.00)  
      f. approving the revision as per section 5.3.3

   2. Perform a procedure minor modification by:

      a. authorization of Director or SSRO  
      b. using Appendix A: 50.59 Process to assess whether a 50.59 review process is required and complete all required forms  
      c. documenting the minor modification in the Summary of Minor Modifications section with:  
         (1) a description of the minor modification  
         (2) a new revision number  
         (3) name of the approver  
      d. performing the minor modification to pages as necessary  
      e. incrementing the revision number by 0.01 (e.g. Rev. 2.00 to 2.01) on pages changed  
      f. replacing the original pages with the changed pages

   3. Archive changed procedures (revisions and minor modification pages) and retain for a period of not less than five years (TS 6.7.2.h).

   4. Perform a temporary deviation (TS 6.3) from a procedure by:

ADMIN-2 Procedures for Design Features and Quality Assurance
============================================================

I. PURPOSE
----------

   Design features and conditions that are set by the Safety Analysis Report
   determine the requirements for quality assurance of specific facility
   features. This procedure provides the guidance for review and
   identification of structures, systems and components that require quality
   assurance of design changes.

II. DESCRIPTION
---------------

   The level of quality assurance is relative to the safety features or
   design conditions of a structure, system or component. Two activities
   require the application of all sections of the quality assurance program.
   One structure or system is the clad system for the fuel elements that
   provides the primary physical barrier against fission product release. The
   second system is any transportation package, Type B, that will transport
   radioactive fuel elements.

   Other building features, systems and components that are important to
   safety do not require complete quality assurance documentation. These
   building features or support systems none-the-less, may require quality
   assurance review to obtain an acceptable level and type of performance.
   Systems such as the instrumentation control and safety system, radiation
   monitoring or measuring systems and life safety equipment are examples of
   systems or components that should require implementation of one or more
   sections of the quality assurance plan. Application of any section will be
   to assure appropriate levels of system or equipment performance.

ADMIN-3 Procedures for Personnel and Operator Qualifications
============================================================

I. PURPOSE
----------

   The choice of personnel for job positions at the NETL facility includes
   license commitments and university job classification requirements.

II. DESCRIPTION
---------------

   The special nature of key job positions, such as persons that direct the
   operation of reactor operators and persons that are reactor operators
   require training and qualification that exceed the standard university job

ADMIN-4 Radiation Protection Program
====================================

I. INTRODUCTION
---------------

A. PURPOSE
~~~~~~~~~~

   To establish a radiation protection program based on sound  
   engineering and radiation protection principles.

B. DESCRIPTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The unique hazards associated with exposures to radiation fields  
   and radioactive materials require special considerations such as  
   training of workers, monitoring of workers and work areas, and  
   planning for unusual conditions. The importance of the radiation  
   protection program requires the assignment of one person with the  
   primary responsibility to implement the radiation protection  
   program.

   The NRC regulations in 10CFR20 are the ultimate basis for the  
   procedures and requirements of the program. However, as Texas  
   is an agreement state, some aspects of the radiation protection  
   program must also meet the TDSHS regulations in 25TAC289.

C. SCHEDULE
~~~~~~~~~~~
   Apply as necessary to establish and maintain an appropriate  
   radiation protection program.

ADMIN-6 Authorization of Experiments
====================================

I. Purpose
----------

   The purpose of this procedure is to establish specific controls to review and analyze experiments. The process applies prior to the use of any experiment in the reactor and subsequent to initial operation to evaluate the routine application of the experiment.


II. Description
---------------

   Reactor safety is a function of 3 basic physical conditions; (1) the reactivity available for changing the reactor criticality conditions, (2) the effects of temperature and hydraulic flow conditions that change coolant flow or neutron peak powers and (3) mechanical stress that might rearrange structures or components of the core configuration. An evaluation of each of the materials that will be in each experiment is done to identify both operational hazards and possible potential hazards. Limits will be set on experiments to assure that the proper safety conditions are met. Procedures may be necessary for some experiments to assure safe reactor and experiment operation.

A. Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   1. Submit experiment request to the Supervisory Operator (class A; SRO). All
      experiment requests involving materials placed in the pool or exposed to direct
      radiations from the pool require authorization.

   2. Determine experiment description; operation requirements, class (A, B, C),
      facility, materials, estimate times, and the experiment type (special or
      routine).

   3. Review the experiment:

      3.1 Special Experiment - Nuclear Reactor Committee and Reactor Supervisor or class A operator (SRO) shall:  
         (a) Review experiment request for approval. Request is to be comparable to the guidance criteria.  
         (b) Refer to *Experiment Review*.  
         (c) Document review on *Experiment Authorization* form.  
         (d) Attach the analysis and any special procedures to the authorization form as a file record.  
         (e) Authorize approval as a special experiment by signature of the Supervisory Operator and by designated member of committee.

      3.2 Routine Experiments - Reactor Supervisor or Class A operator (SRO) shall:  
         (a) Verify experiment conditions for approval. Conditions are to be equivalent to the experiment authorization.  
         (b) Refer to *Experiment Review*.  
         (c) Complete applicable *Operation Request* form, Sample  
         (d) Note any deviations from the authorization and any special safety hazards or instructions.  
         (e) Authorize experiment by signature of supervisory operator.

      3.3 Minor deviations from the routine experiment may be approved although  
         routine deviations shall require experiment amendment and reactor  
         committee approval.

      3.4 Operations for operator training, demonstrations, maintenance, or  
         surveillance per reactor committee approved procedures does not require  
         the existence of an experiment authorization. The SRO shall assign an  
         appropriate experiment designation from the “Schedule of Experiments”  
         for each activity.

   4. Verify operator's and experimenter's knowledge of experiment and procedures.

   5. Perform the experiment following procedures specified by the experiment
      authorization.

   6. Review experimental results:

      6.1 Special experiments - Nuclear Reactor Committee and Reactor Supervisor  
      or class A operator (SRO) shall:  
      (a) Review experiment results by comparison to guidance criteria.  
      (b) Document comments on *Experiment Authorization* form.  
      (c) Authorize approval as a routine experiment by signature of the Supervisory Operator and by designated member of the committee.

      6.2 Routine Experiments - Reactor Committee should:  
      (a) Verify experimental results are equivalent to the experiment authorization.  
      (b) Review should be noted by signature of the Supervisory Operator on applicable forms (*Operation Request*, etc.)

      6.3 Reclassification as a routine experiment may not be appropriate for certain types of experiments that are not intended for periodic applications.

B. Experiment Classes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   1. Class A experiments require a senior operator (Class A, SRO) to direct an activity  
      or experiment.

   2. Class B experiments require only an operator and if necessary an  
      experimenter(Class B, RO) to perform the experiment, with an SRO available.

   3. Class C experiments are all non-reactor experiments.

C. Experiment Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   1. A special experiment is an experiment which is authorized for one application.

   2. A routine experiment is an experiment which is authorized for repeat applications.
