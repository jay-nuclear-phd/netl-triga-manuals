OPER-4 Operation of Reactor Water Systems
=========================================

I. Introduction
---------------

A. Purpose
^^^^^^^^^^

This procedure details the steps for operation, startup, and shutdown of the reactor water systems.

B. Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The reactor water system is composed of the reactor pool and two water process systems.
The pool structure contains water that moderates the neutron energy spectrum, cools the fuel in the reactor core, and provides radiation shielding. Pool water level sensors provide detection of water loss conditions.

Pool water purity is maintained by operation of the purification system.  
A pump, pool suction, pool skimmer, pool return, piping, valves, filter, resin tank with resin, flow meter, and instrumentation comprise the purification system.  
At a normal flow of 6 to 10 gallons per minute, the approximately 10,500-gallon volume of the pool flows through the system once every 18 to 29 hours.  
Sensors in the purification piping monitor water conductivity.

Bulk pool water temperature is controlled by operation of the coolant system when the reactor is operated at power levels above 100 Kilowatt and/or for extended periods of time.  
A central chilling station at the university site provides the cooling heat sink.  
Water pressure control prevents water system leakage from the primary pool water to the secondary chilling water.  
An alarm annunciates loss of differential pressure control at the heat exchanger.

C. Schedule
^^^^^^^^^^^

Apply this procedure daily or each time the reactor is taken through an operation cycle of startup and shutdown.

II. PROCEDURE
-------------

A. General Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Check pool water level each time the water system status changes.
   Status changes are startup or shutdown of the purification or coolant system.
   Normal pool water level is 8.10 ± 0.05 meters.
   (Measure pool level relative to the bottom of the reactor tank.)

2. Monitor pool level by continual or intermittent (daily) observation.

   a. A pool level monitor provides monitoring of hi or lo conditions.
   Alarm levels are hi (+5 cm) and lo (-5 cm) relative to the 8.10-meter level.

   b. Siphon breaks are present on the purification and coolant system pipes.
   Siphon break levels are at pool levels of 7.6 meters or above.

   c. Make visual observations of pool level at least twice each day:

   i.   If the pool level monitor is not functioning and;
   ii.  A system without siphon breaks can cause a siphon action, or
   iii. A system without siphon breaks extends below the siphon break level.

3. Replace pool water evaporation losses with makeup supply de-ionized water.
   Follow makeup water instructions in surveillance procedures (refer to SURV-4).
   Review makeup water volume each month.
   Abnormal water loss may be an indication of a leak.

4. Operate the pool purification system per instructions in Section B.
   Purification system should maintain pool conductivity less than 2 µmho/cm.
   Pool conductivity limit is 5 µmho/cm (monthly average).

   a. The purification system should be operated continuously but it is not a requirement for reactor operation.

   b. If purification system is operating:
   A reactor operator presence in the facility is *not* a requirement.

5. Operate the pool coolant system per instructions in Section C.
   Coolant system should maintain pool temperature less than 38°C (100°F).
   Pool temperature maximum limit is 48°C (118°F). No minimum limit has been set.

   a. Coolant system operation is not a requirement for reactor operation.
   It should be operated at reactor power levels above 100 kW except for power calibrations.

   b. If the coolant system is operating:
   A reactor operator should be present at the facility.
   A reactor operator should periodically check system conditions.

6. Monitor performance of pool purification and coolant water systems.

2. Startup:

   a. OPEN pool suction and discharge valves (4" SS) at pool surface.
   OPEN the pool diffuser isolation valve (2 1/2" SS) at pool surface.
   Valves alignment should be as follows for proper mixing:

   i.   Discharge valve position should be 7/8 open.
   ii.  Diffuser valve position should be full open.

   b. OPEN the chill water return isolation valve from heat exchanger.
   OPEN the chill water supply isolation valve to heat exchanger.

   c. Verify differential pressure provides alarm indication at < 1 psi (7 kpa).

   iii. Confirm chill water supply temperature is approximately 45F (7C).

   .. caution::

     If pool temperature is at the control set point temperature,  
     chill water circulation may be at or near ambient system temperature.

   f. STARTUP heat exchanger pool water pump.

   i.   Check mechanical seal for leakage.
   ii.  Verify normal flow rate of 85-95% flow.

**Purification, Coolant, or Pool System Leaks**

1. Identify whether the leak rate is observable directly or indirectly.
   Directly observable leaks are drip or stream flows, or obvious instrument changes.
   Indirect leaks (very small leaks) are slow drips, wet or damp areas.
   Indirect leaks include losses found by calculation or evaluation of records.
   Notify the SRO.

2. Determine whether the leakage is in the purification or coolant system.
   If not, is the leak a pool structure leak?

3. Identify whether the leakage is pool water or chilled water.

4. Shutdown purification or coolant system operation if substantial leak rate occurs.
   Substantial amount is a rate in excess of a few drips per minute.

   If the leak can’t be isolated, it is continuing, and the outlook for immediate leak containment is not promising,
   then shutdown of the reactor may be required.
   An SRO should evaluate and determine the requirement(s) for reactor shutdown.

5. Close isolation valves at pool surface.

6. Drain piping system into suitable container for storage.
   If possible, store or return piping water to the pool.

SRO shall determine requirement for reactor shutdown.

1. *Loss of differential pressure control:*
   a. Inspect system operation for cause.
   b. Alarm status if: Δp < 7 kpad (Δp < 1 psid)
   Requires shutdown of coolant system or corrective action in progress, unless the event is a single, infrequent transient indication.
   c. Alarm status if: 14 ≤ Δp ≤ 35 kpad (2 ≤ Δp ≤ 5 psid)
   Cooling system may continue operation,
   if fault is the measurement system and periodic checks (4/hr) are made to verify system pressures.
   Initiate check of functional performance,
   Check for faulty equipment prior to next system operation.

2. *Loss of operation heat sink control*

D. Radioactivity Release to Water
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Identify release type according to the following guidelines:
Notify SRO. Notify HP if abnormal radioactivity level is detectable.

1. *Immediate – observable event*
   ⇒ Breakage of a material containment
   ⇒ Accidental drop of an object into the pool

   Any material or object that drops into the pool is an uncontrollable event;
   (Requires immediate action) Notify supervisory operator and:

   a. Shutdown reactor operation if
   object rests on the core grid structure,
   or object rests on the control rod devices.
   b. Observe location to allow effective removal,
   and schedule removal of the material as soon as practical.
   c. Identify material as solid or dispersible such as liquid or powder.
   d. Consider possible corrosion impact if material may chemically react with:
   Aluminum, stainless steel or other reactor system materials.

2. *Unknown – discovery of unusual radiation levels:*
   ⇒ High radiation level at pool area monitor from unknown cause
   (reactor on, > 20mr/hr, reactor off > 1 mr/hr)
   ⇒ High radiation level in water treatment area from unknown cause
   (portable survey > 2mr/hr at door)

   Shutdown reactor operation if there is observation of:

   * An unknown radiation level in the immediate area of the pool.
   * An unknown radiation level in the water treatment areas.

   a. Shutdown operation of purification and coolant systems.
   Close all pool isolation valves.
   b. Review radiation levels.
   Observe the particulate air monitor and gaseous argon-41 monitor.
   c. Notify supervisory reactor operator (SRO) and health physicist (HP).
   SRO or HP will evaluate radiation source.
   d. Control access to all pool water system areas.
   Maintain control until protective action and/or corrective actions are taken.

3. *Persistent – indication of radioactivity release:*
   ⇒ Fuel element failure,
   ⇒ Neutron startup source failure,
   ⇒ Failure of experiment or experiment facility,
   ⇒ Other source failures in the pool, such as the gamma irradiator.
   ⇒ Requires shutdown of the reactor if fission products are detectable.
   SRO shall determine the requirement(s) for reactor shutdown.

   Determine the cause of possible persistent radioactive releases.
   Measure sample volume of the pool water for radioactivity.

   a. Take a 500 ml sample, allow for N16 decay then measure contact dose.
   b. Shutdown reactor, pool coolant and pool purification system; if the sample contact dose exceeds 0.5 mr/hr or 20,000 dpm.
   c. Perform alpha/beta and/or gamma spectroscopy analysis. Identify source element (isotope) of water radioactivity. If fission products identified declare Emergency per PLAN-E.
   d. Perform radiation survey. Survey areas include pool access area, water treatment room, and Piping systems adjacent to the pool structure stairway. Dose rates at the resin tank and heat exchanger are of particular concern.
   e. Restart of the water systems requires approval by SRO.
